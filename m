Okay, I'll try to fix them up so that they don't break the crypto
tree, and given below, I think I should be able to do this with fewer
changes to some of the Kconfig, which will hopefully address your

more straightforward.

Thanks, I think I see what your concern is now. I'll take a stab at
addressing that.
