The classic way to achieve is to raise an error, not a warning.

This should have been achievable through CONFIG_WERROR, however,
the below commit deactivated it with -Wno-error (rationale of why
this was an issue is missing).

commit 20fbb11fe4ea ("don't make the syscall checking produce errors
from warnings")

If we just warn, I am not sure how to emit a warning each time
until it gets fixed. The normal behaviour everywhere else is to
only warn during the first build and be quiet (unless
dependencies change).

ACK

Regardless of the above discussion, I think I will give up on
checksyscalls.sh, at least for the moment. The patch assumed that
checksyscalls.sh would only be called from ./Kbuild. It appears
that there is another user: arch/mips/Makefile c.f. kernel test
robot's report:
https://lore.kernel.org/llvm/202205030015.JCmg5yPS-lkp@intel.com/

Because of that, only creating a single empty file to check the
timestamp is insufficient and I could not find a smart way to
manage all this.

Currently (i.e. before my patch), Kbuild does not stop the build either.
c.f. check-atomics.sh which returns 0 inconditionally:
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.17/source/scripts/atomic/check-atomics.sh#L33

This can be easily remediated by making check-atomics.sh return
an error code if the check does not succeed.

Same comment as before, I expect warnings to only be raised once,
making this an error would solve the issue.

I will send a v2 but only for check-atomics.sh
