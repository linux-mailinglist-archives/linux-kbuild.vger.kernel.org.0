Hi!

We have created a tool for automatic data collection from production stat=
ions that can improve your work and increase the efficiency of processes.

Quick to install and easy to use, the solution will provide you with valu=
able data on performance indicators for the entire factory and individual=
 machines. The tool clearly indicates when the machine/line slows down, w=
hat downtimes it has, and so you know when to react.

You receive valuable knowledge about the production status and the reason=
s for possible delays. Thanks to the ability to react immediately to emer=
ging problems and symptoms, you increase your work efficiency by several =
dozen percent.

Do you want to test such a solution for free in your company?


Best regards
Kurt Birky
