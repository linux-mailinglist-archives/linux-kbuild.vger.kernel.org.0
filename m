Thank you for detailed explanation. Well I guess question then is: how 
much scan-build is supported? And if it should even support mixing clang 
and gcc? Alternatively maybe use clang as default if CC environment 
variable is not set?
What I like about scan-build is that it generates html report file.

'--use-cc=clang' worked fine for me.

I've also tried
 > $ make -j"$(nproc)" LLVM=1 defconfig bindeb-pkg static-analyzer
although there seems to be no static-analyzer target, I guess you meant 
clang-analyzer instead, but although it seems to generate a lot of text 
on terminal, it doesn't seem that useful to me. Not sure if this is 
expected?

Quoting a piece of log:

Unless I did something wrong, this doesn't seem that useful to me 
compared to what I get from scan-build?
