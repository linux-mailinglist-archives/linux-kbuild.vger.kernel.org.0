Sorry for the delay.
I am OK with the idea of allowing users to override the pkg-config command,
but I tend to take time before making a decision.




Does anybody have any insight / thoughts about the following points?






[Q1]   with/without "HOST" prefix


Apparently, "pkg-config" should return different libs/cflags
for $(CC) and $(HOSTCC).

I think the non-prefixed macro name "PKG_CONFIG" should be
reserved for $(CC)  (building for the target system).

"HOSTPKG_CONFIG" looks unbalanced
due to the underscore.

Perhaps, "HOST_PKG_CONFIG" might be better?




[Q2]    "pkg-config" vs "pkgconf"

The traditional pkg-config implementation [1] is not actively
maintained these days.
The last commit was more than one year ago.

The alternative one 'pkgconf' [2] is more active.

In fact, Fedora already switched to 'pkgconf' [3].
Now 'pkg-config' is just a wrapper of 'pkgconf'.
Many distributions already support pkgconf.


I considered the shorter macro name "HOSTPKGCONF" and

   HOSTPKGCONF  = pkgconf

but I am not sure if this is the right decision.
Maybe we should stick to "PKG_CONFIG" / "HOST_PKG_CONFIG"
for the macro names.

  [2]  https://github.com/pkgconf/pkgconf.git
  [3]  https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/pkgconf_as_system_pkg-config_implementation





[Q3] What is the trend of handling cross-compile by pkg-config (or pkgconf).


By default, pkg-config returns the libs/cflags for native builds.

For cross builds, the search paths for the *.pc files must be changed
via the "PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR" environment variable.

To ease this, some distributions provide  <triplet>-pkg-config
(for example,   aarch64-linux-gnu-pkg-config).
This became the nationale for tools/build/feature/Makefile defining:

   PKG_CONFIG ?= $(CROSS_COMPILE)pkg-config

But, this wrapper shell script is not always available.
I do not know how to do it with the LLVM tool suite.
I am not quite sure if this is the global solution.


These days, pkgconf supports another way, .personality file [4]
to specify the .pc search paths for cross builds.

Is it reasonable to use an option to distinguish native / cross builds
and use the same macro   "PKG_CONFIG = pkg-config" everywhere ?
