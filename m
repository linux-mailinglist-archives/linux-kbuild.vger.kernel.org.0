I think that 20.04 LTS or 18.04 LTS didn't by default (or I wouldn't have the need to
build a home-built dpkg-deb in the first place), and it was a big issue back then:

[1] https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=501456

[2] https://askubuntu.com/questions/841784/any-way-to-multithread-dpkg-deb

It was an issue back then already, but on a system with 6+ cores the difference is significant.
Of course, back then a 4-core/8-thread CPU was a rocket :-)

If I could only teleport this system back to 2000s and use it with those ideas 8-)

Best regards,
Mirsad
