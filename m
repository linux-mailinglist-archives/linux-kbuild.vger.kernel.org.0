Hey Miguel,

Just to make it very clear from the beginning, while this is a sensitive 
subject, and I am very passionate about it; In no way, I am being 
offensive, insulting or rude. This would be obvious in a f2f discussion 
of course, but alas. I do try to format my text as friendly as I can, 
but some things get lost in translation ;)

Consitency is absolutly important! Zero argument there. My argument is, 
the consistency should be within the kernel tree, not 'but the rest of 
the world is using style X/Y/Z, lets be consistent with that. In an 
utopia, maybe, but the real world doesn't work that way, sadly. So in an 
attempt to standardize (rustfmt) they just "invented" a new standard. 
Which btw is common, we see this happening every so often, right?

Copy/pasting is known to cause bugs. There's actually research from NASA 
on that. Code-reuse (libraries/functions) are not bad. But (worst kind 
of example) copy paste from stack-overflow, or copy/pasting stuff 
without actually looking at the content and forgetting to rename 
something, causes bugs. Why is this relevant? The whole 'lets be 
consistent with the rust codebase of the wrold' argument. E.g. if 
everybody uses the same style (which is idealistic and great) then 
copy/pasting becomes consistent. Where I say, try to be careful when 
copy/pasting code.

There have been, I've linked them in my first post; the devs basically 
say 'you are right, we are sorry; but this discussion is over' which 
reads as 'we love our style, we think its great, we're not changing it 
for people with reading-disabilitles, figure it out' (yes, I paraphrase 
it much harsher then what they state, but like with people in 
wheelchairs that run into a small staircase (1 or 2 treads), and then 
are being told, sorry, it is what it is, we can't fix this, it's been 
like this for years, it is what it is)

I appose for feeling insulted, that was surely not my intend! What I am 
stating however is, that by stating 'but rustfmt is great, their 
standard is consistent and simple and amazing', the message implies 
(nofi!) that reading disabilities do not matter, because this new 
standard is so great.

Yes, as I do suffer from a reading disability, so I know how hard this 
is :) but fear not, I'm not alone, just vocal.

Obviously I do not intend to cunstruct straw-men, as to me, this is all 
very real and painful :)

I'm not, I'm saying 'every language has its own standard(s), lets make 
one that is better then the others'. So instead of rust for example 
following the linux kernel standard (or the Go coding standard, or 
X/Y/Z), they came up with their own. Not bad, but as mentioned earlier, 
requires careful thinking. But it is of course their choice!

No, do use it! rustfmt is pretty amazing. And rustfmt knows there's not 
a single answer on coding style, so the rustfmt tool, is super 
configurable trying to match any code-base needs, without forcing 
anybodies style. It is actually like you say, below, the defauflts that 
come from the rust group itself.

I'd prefer if we keep it to style and readability (rustfmt) :p as cargo 
is more a technical direction, and not relevant; but point noted.

But if that is the case, why not try to follow the kernels existing 
code-style as close as possible with the rust-fmt configuration? I know 
code-style has been discussed a few times over the decades; but not many 
changes have been done, surely, if there's some codestyle changes that 
are best for the kernel, they would have been 'advised'? '4 space 
indents are better then 8-size tabs, on new code, try to use them' for 
example :p

But why? Why should we not be consistent with the kernels' code-base 
(while yes, that is not rust, but C, but we can follow the same style?)

But is this a bad thing? Being consistent within the kernel repo? Who 
cares what the rest of the ruts code does? I know it matters for 
user-space; but I know that my user-space rust code (be it linux, or 
micro) actually follows the kernel style, not the rust style :p becaues 
of my disability, the rust format is not easy to read/parse in my head 
due to small inconsistencies.

So I fully agree with the first part; but not with the last part :p As 
the rust code style, is poor on readability for people with 
reading-disabilities.

That is of course the downside, that if user-space is writing their own 
code in their own style, it will either be rust-style, or something 
completly different, we have no control of this anyway; but having it 
'match' is 'nice' from a consistency pov;

Sadly, I've seen so much vendor code (yeah, I know) which doesn't even 
have consistency in their own files ...
