We have kallsyms we had to link three times because the linking
increased the object a little in size so symbols did not match.
The last time was added more or less only to check that we did
have stable symbol addresses.

All this predates LTO stuff which we only introduced later.

The reason for doing modpost on vmlinux.o was that we had cases
where everything in drivers/ was fine but there was section mismatch
references from arch/* to drivers/*
This is back when there were much more drivers in arch/ than what we
have today.
And back then we also had much more to check ad we had cPU hotplug
that could really cause section mismatches - this is no longer the case
which is a good thing.

So we checked vmlinx - but vmlinx did have too much stripped away.
so in reality nothing was checked.
To allow the warnings to be as precise as possible move the checks
out to the indovidual .o files.
Sometimes the names was mangled a little so if warnigns was only
reported on vmlinx level in could be difficult to track down the
offender.
This would then also do the check on .o files that had all the
relocation symbols rtequired.

But when we introduced check of the individual .o fiules we missed when
the references spanned outside the .o files as explained previously.
So included a link of vmlinx.o that did NOT drop the relocations
so we could use it to check for the remaining section mismatch warnings.

Remember - back when we started this we had many hundred warnings
and it was a fight to keep that number low.
But we also wanted to report as much as possible.

There was back then several discussions if this was really worth the
effort. How much was gained from discarding the memory where the
section mismatch warnigns was triggered.
In other words - how about just keeping the init code in memory so there
were no illegal references anymore.
That is something that is maybe worth to consiuder again as we have even
less memory we save by throwing away the init code.
But I think this is a topic for another mail thread.
