Of course. 
Fisrt of all, I have seen (i.e. openSUSE Tumbleweed) that in the same way
that vmlinuz, System.map and config was not copied when the rpm was
installed (because of the reason that you commented with the missing
script), they were not removed when the rpm was removed, so I have added
the lines to remove in a similar way as you suggested for install. 
And I have seen as well (i.e. openSUSE Tumbleweed)) that if the a new rpm
is installed (same release but bigger build version to use default options
for the tool), vmlinuz, System.map and config are not copied from %post
because vmlinuz, System.map and config already exist and the situation is
not good, because /lib/modules/{KERNELRELEASE} is updated but the commented
files in /boot are not updated. That is the reason why I have tried to
identify when vmlinuz, System.map and config are not the good ones, to copy
too.
Besides, in the commented situation, the older rpm (same release but older
build version) is removed and with that, the new vmlinuz, System.map and
config are removed too. That is the reason that I have tried to identify
again the files, removing only the suitable vmlinuz, System.map and config
with the same release and build number requested.

> And, is the output of 'file' standardized?
With no more information, file is going to print the strings in the file,
that is, the information containig release, version, ... and here we can
find what we are interested in. So in some way depends on vmlinuz binary.

You are right, again good catch.
I will try to think something for aarch64. Maybe something more general,
and  independent of the kernel binary name, is possible and valid for other
architectures, maybe with rpm command.
If nothing comes up, I will do only for x86.

I did not want to modify the style.
Ok, I will follow your suggestion, it's clearer to me too.

Thanks
