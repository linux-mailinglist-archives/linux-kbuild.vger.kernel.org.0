I think this would make more sense as two patches:

  - Add a "PCI_ID_DRIVER_OVERRIDE" flag.  This is not VFIO-specific,
    since nothing in PCI depends on the VFIO-ness of drivers that use
    the flag.  The only point here is that driver id_table entries
    with this flag only match when driver_override matches the driver.

  - Update file2alias.c to export the flags and the "vfio_pci:" alias.
    This seems to be the only place where VFIO comes into play, and
    putting it in a separate patch will make it much smaller and it
    will be clear how it could be extended for other buses.

Thanks a lot for this!  I didn't know about drivers_probe (see
drivers_probe_store()), and it doesn't seem to be documented anywhere
except sysfs-bus-usb, where it's only incidental to USB.
