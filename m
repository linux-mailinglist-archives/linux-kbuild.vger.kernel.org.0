From my perspective, I'm okay if gendwarfksyms doesn't provide
functionality to compare a new object file with its reference symtypes
file.

As mentioned, genksyms has this functionality but I actually think the
way it works is not ideal. Its design is to operate on one compilation
unit at the time. This has the advantage that a comparison of each file
is performed in parallel during the build, simply because of the make
job system. On the other hand, it has two problems.

The first one is that genksyms doesn't provide a comparison of the
kernel as a whole. This means that the tool gives rather scattered and
duplicated output about changed structs in the build log. Ideally, one
would like to see a single compact report about what changed at the end
of the build.

The second problem is the handling of symtypes files. This data is large
and if one wants to store them in a Git repository together with the
kernel source, it is advisable to first compress/consolidate it in some
way. This is trivial because these files typically contain many
duplicates. However, the issue is that to feed the data back to
genksyms, they need to be unpacked during each build which can take some
time.

I think a better approach is to have a tool that can be given
a consolidated symtypes file as one input and can compare it with all
new symtypes files produced during a kernel build. An example of a tool
that takes this approach is the kabi Python script in UEK [1].

A few months ago, I also started working on a tool inspired by this
script. The goal is to have similar functionality but hopefully with
a much faster implementation. Hence, this tool is written in a compiled
language (Rust at the moment) and should also become multi-threaded. I'm
hoping to find some time to make progress on it and make the code
public. It could later be added to the upstream kernel to replace the
comparison functionality implemented by genksyms, if there is interest.

So as mentioned, I'm fine if gendwarfksyms doesn't have this
functionality. However, for distributions that rely on the symtypes
format, I'd be interested in having gendwarfksyms output its dump data
in this format as well.

For example, instead of producing:

gendwarfksyms: process_exported_symbols: _some_mangled_func_name (@ XYZ)
subprogram(
   [formal parameters...]
)
-> structure_type core::result::Result<(), core::fmt::Error> {
   [a description of the structure...]
};

.. the output could be something like this:

S#'core::result::Result<(), core::fmt::Error>' structure_type core::result::Result<(), core::fmt::Error> { [a description of the structure...] }
_some_mangled_func_name subprogram _some_mangled_func_name ( [formal parameters...] ) -> S#'core::result::Result<(), core::fmt::Error>'

Correct, (open)SUSE kernels have placeholders in likely-to-change
structs which can be used for new members. Or if no placeholder is
present, it might be necessary to place a new member in a gap (padding)
in the struct layout.

I like this idea. I think it's good that the necessary kABI information
about an updated member can be expressed at the source code level in
place of the actual change, and it isn't needed to feed additional input
to the tool.
