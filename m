Your patches as they stand will break the crypto tree.  So
that's why they should not go in without the proper changes.

No CONFIG_CRYPTO is not the issue.  This depends on specific
bits of the Crypto API such as CRYPTO_HASH.  Simply selecting
it is also not acceptable because you will be forcing all of the
Crypto API into vmlinux even though none of it is required by
/dev/random.
