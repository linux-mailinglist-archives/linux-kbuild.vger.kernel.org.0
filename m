hi,
I tried this version and can't see the symbols size

[root@qemu jolsa]# cat /proc/kallmodsyms | grep ksys_ | head -5
ffffffff81094720 T ksys_ioperm
ffffffff81141110 T ksys_unshare
ffffffff81160410 T ksys_setsid
ffffffff811c64b0 T ksys_sync_helper
ffffffff813213c0 T ksys_fadvise64_64

I have CONFIG_KALLMODSYMS=y, but I haven't checked if I need
anything else
