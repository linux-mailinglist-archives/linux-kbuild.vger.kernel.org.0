I agree with this. CC is only changing the compiler, not any of the
other build utilities. CC=gcc-12 works for GCC because you are only
using a different compiler, not an entirely new toolchain (as binutils
will be the same as just CC=gcc).

However, I think we could still address Peter's complaint of "there
should be an easier way for me to use the tools that are already in my
PATH" with his first iteration of this patch [1], which I feel is
totally reasonable:

$ make LLVM=-14

It is still easy to use (in fact, it is shorter than 'CC=clang-14') and
it does not change anything else about how we build with LLVM. We would
just have to add something along the lines of

"If your LLVM tools have a suffix like Debian's (clang-14, ld.lld-14,
etc.), use LLVM=<suffix>.

$ make LLVM=-14"

to Documentation/kbuild/llvm.rst.

I might change the patch not to be so clever though:

ifneq ($(LLVM),)
ifneq ($(LLVM),1)
LLVM_SFX := $(LLVM)
endif
endif
