Indeed... :(

I thought that's what you were suggesting, but I guess you meant just
separate internal targets. Separate targets exposed to the user are
useful as well. I've had some requests to be able to skip running
yamllint for example. The processed schema can be used for a few other
tools now, so being able to just build it is useful.
