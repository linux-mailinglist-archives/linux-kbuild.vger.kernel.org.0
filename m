Sounds reasonable, but IMO this can be done after the original
implementation is done.

Thanks for the test!

Yes, this will be complicated, given some variables are set before
executing makepkg.

This would be different from the other `foo-pkg` targets.
And it would still not be clear how to handle the overriden variables.

I've added you to my Cc list.

It was chosen to be similar to the other `foo-pkg` targets.
But if there is a documented standard way for Arch, I'm in favor of
using it.

It is unusual for Arch, but IMO the best fit.
The other alternative would be to fix pkgrel to "1" and integrate the
version counter into the version itself.

They won't be installed, but still be validated.
