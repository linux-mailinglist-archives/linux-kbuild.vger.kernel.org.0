I do not see the related code in scripts/Makefile.build.

Honestly, I do not understand what it exactly means that "in-tree
livepatches would occasionally be post-processed incorrectly".

Is it the problem that modpost is not able to handle the unresolved
symbols that have to be updated by klp-convert?

All the tricky code is removed in the 5th patch. My understanding is
that the problem causing the cyclic dependency is solved by modifying
modpost.

It looks like this patch is outdated and mostly obsoleted. On the
other hand, the commit message in 5th patch is too short.

What about merging the two patches and updating the commit message?
