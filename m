Yes, it explains the issue.

It works. Thanks Joe.

I think _safe from list_for_each_entry_safe(rela, tmprela, &sec->relas, 
list) in the main loop could be dropped, because convert_rela() only marks 
relas and does not move them anywhere. 
Similarly, list_for_each_entry_safe(r1, r2, &oldsec->relas, list) in 
convert_rela() itself.
