'make rustupoverride' potentially requires internet connection
if the required rustc version is not yet installed on the system.

Even if it is already installed, it changes ~/.rustup/settings.toml.


If I do rustupoverride per-directory,

$ make O=3D~/kernel/build0 rustupoverride
$ make O=3D~/kernel/build1 rustupoverride
$ make O=3D~/kernel/build2 rustupoverride

it would accumulate the overrides entries in ~/.rustup/settings.toml


Rather, I will manually do this one time for the parent directory:

$ rustup override set --path=3D/~kernel $(scripts/min-tool-version.sh rustc=
)


and use ~/kernel/build0, ~/kernel/build1, ~/kernel/build2
as output directories.



In principle, Kbuild does not require internet connection,
or proactively change the system setting.

If you want to provide a way for automated settings,
you can do it in a script you maintain.
