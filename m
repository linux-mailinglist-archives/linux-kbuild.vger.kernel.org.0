Isn't this already part of the FIT spec? There's nothing special here.
It's one configuration that lists a base DTB plus some addon overlays.

The FIT spec says:

  - fdt : Unit name of the corresponding fdt blob (component image node of =
a
    "fdt type"). Additional fdt overlay nodes can be supplied which signify
    that the resulting device tree blob is generated by the first base fdt
    blob with all subsequent overlays applied.

Are you saying that U-boot currently lacks a mechanism to select the config=
?
A quick skim over U-boot code suggests that boards need to implement
board_fit_config_name_match()?

It is possible to build overlays separately, and have the build system
apply them. Taking an example from the Renesas tree (line wrap mine):

    dtb-$(CONFIG_ARCH_R8A779G0) +=3D r8a779g0-white-hawk.dtb
    dtb-$(CONFIG_ARCH_R8A779G0) +=3D r8a779g0-white-hawk-ard-audio-da7212.d=
