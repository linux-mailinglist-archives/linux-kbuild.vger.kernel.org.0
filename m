Just for some contexts.

This idea has been discussed multiple times. The earliest discussion
that I can recall is from a tea-break-time discussion in Kangrejos 2022.

It was brought up recently in a discussion related to DRM,
and the consensus was that it's definitely a idea worth exploring.

I am pretty sure lockdep needs to do some internal allocation anyway
because only address matters for lock class keys. So some extra
allocation probably is fine...

Location objects are constants, so they are not guaranteed to have a
fixed address. With inlining and generics you can very easily get
multiple instances of it. That said, their address is also not
significant, so LLVM is pretty good at merging them back to one single
address, **if everything is linked statically**.

The merging is an optimisation, and is far from guaranteed. With kernel
modules, which effectively is dynamic linking, the address of `Location`
*will* be duplicated if the function invoking a `#[track_caller]`
function is inlined.

An idea was flared when I discussed this with Josh Triplett in last
Kangrejos, that it might be possible to make `Location` generated by
compiler be `static` rather than just normal constants, and then we can
ensure that the address is unique. I tried to prototype this idea but
it didn't seem to work very well because currently you can use
`#[track_caller]` in a const fn but can't refer to statics in a const
fn, so it's a bit hard to desugar. I am pretty sure there are ways
around it, but someone would need to implement it :)

So TL;DR: while in many cases the address is unique, it's far from a
guarantee. It might be possible to guarantee uniqueness but that
requires compiler changes.
