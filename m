Even if the distro does not match it will likely work to configure SRPM
for non-matching distro and then build it on the target distro but I have
not tested it.

That's basically the same thing as the patch that has been rejected.

I used := to prevent calling pkg-config every time MODLIB is used but it
might not be the most flexible wrt overrides.

However, I can easily imagine a distribution that would want to put
modules in /usr/lib-amd64-linux/modules.

Yes, that's the semantics of the tool. The jq version was slightly less
convoluted but required additional tool for building the kernel.

Because it's kmod property, not libkmod property.

Distributions would install libkmod.pc only with development files
whereas the kmod.pc should be installed with the binaries.
