I checked the diff.

Back in November, the key/cert were generated in /root directory.

In the latest instruction, the recommended location is
/var/lib/shim-signed/mok/.

Sorry, I do not understand what you are talking about.

I assume you are talking about v1 patch.
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-kbuild/patch/20211013200536.1851070-1-willy@infradead.org/

Honestly, I did not have expert knowledge in the secure boot,
but anyway I observed build errors, and I pointed it out.

Other than the build error, your original patch was written in the way
to use CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_KEY  for signing the kernel.
This is the same between v1 and v2.

Looking at the instruction in the Debian page,
now I am wondering if this is the right thing to do
because signing the kernel and signing the modules
are different things.

The old debian page (I checked the old page back in November)
did not mention CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_KEY either.

I agree on this point.
It will be nice to avoid manual work in the kernel signing steps.

Sorry for the delay and annoyance.

After reading the latest Debian doc closely, I think we can automate
the kernel signing by using the key located in /var/lib/shim-signed/mok/
instead of CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_KEY.


If I am wrong, I hope some input from people in the CC list.
