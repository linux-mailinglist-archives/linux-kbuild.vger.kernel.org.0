Yeah, banning technically valid code like this is going to be a very hard sell.

I leave that to you - to me any of these options would be ok:

1. Remove completely for now.

2. Make it 'depends on BROKEN' (because I think even 'depends on
EXPERT' won't help avoid the inevitable spam from test robots).

3. Make it a purely opt-in sanitizer: rather than having subsystems
opt out with UBSAN_WRAP_UNSIGNED:=n, do the opposite and say that for
subsystems that want to opt in, they have to specify
UBSAN_WRAP_UNSIGNED:=y to explicitly opt in.

I can see there being value in explicitly marking semantically
intended unsigned integer wrap, and catch unintended cases, so option
#3 seems appealing. At least that way, if a maintainer chooses to opt
in, they are committed to sorting out their code. Hypothetically, if I
was the maintainer of some smaller subsystem and have had wrap around
bugs in the past, I would certainly consider opting in. It feels a lot
nicer than having it forced upon me.

Thanks,
