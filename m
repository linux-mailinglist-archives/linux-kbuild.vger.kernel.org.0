Does your objection apply to the proposed implementation, or the feature
request itself? If the former, what aspect of the approach do you
consider problematic?

Using CONFIG symbols would be another way to specify the input list of
directories that should be instrumented for GCOV profiling. The output
would still need to be a different c_flags value for source files in
these directories though. I would assume that getting this information
from CONFIG values into c_flags would be a more intrusive change
compared to the route via a Makefile variable.

GCOV instrumentation is a per-source file build-time decision. There's
no way to dynamically turn it on or off during run-time.

I don't feel very strongly about this specific feature - it seemed to me
that it could be implemented in a non-intrusive way and it provides
value to at least one developer.
