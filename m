It seems to me as if there is some confusion about in-tree vs.
out-of-tree kmods.

KBUILD_EXTMOD and M are almost the same and indicate that you want to
build _external_ (=out-of-tree) kernel modules.  In-tree modules are
only those that stay in-tree _and_ are built along with the kernel.
Thus, 'make modules KBUILD_EXTMOD=fs/ext4' could be used to build ext4
kmod as "out-of-tree" kernel module, that even taints the kernel if it
gets loaded.

If you want bpf_testmod.ko to be an in-tree kmod, it has to be build
during the usual kernel build, not by running 'make kselftest'.

If you use 'make -C $(KDIR)' for building out-of-tree kmods, KDIR has to
point to the kernel build directory.  (Or it may point to the source
tree if you give O=$(BUILDDIR) as well).

HTH.

Kind regards,
Nicolas
