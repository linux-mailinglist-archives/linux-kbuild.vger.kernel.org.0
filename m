Let me do a series of builds with the two patches above against
next-20220721 to see if there are any instances of this warning across
the less frequently tested architectures then I will review/ack this.

I don't think we need to worry much about backslide, as -Wformat is
enabled with W=1, which the 0day folks already test with, so new
instances of this warning should get reported to the authors when they
are introduced so they can be fixed immediately. However, I would still
like to see this applied sooner rather than later, although I would also
like us to be completely warning clean before doing so, especially with
-Werror now being selected with all{mod,yes}config. -rc8 is this Sunday
and final should be July 31st so I think this could be applied at some
point between those two dates then maybe sent to Linus for a late pull
request once all other trees have been merged but that is ultimately up
to Masahiro.

Cheers,
Nathan
