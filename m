I am considering how to implement it.



One way is to add env variables as a new request arises.

Sergey is doing two things by one option.


   KCONFIG_WARN_UNKNWON_SYMBOL : warn unknown symbol in input .config
or defconfig
   KCONFIG_WARN_TO_ERROR       : turn warnings into errors



Another way is to handle those as command line options.

  -Wunknown-symbol
  -Werror             (associated with W=3De)
  -Wall               (associated with W=3D1)



  $ make W=3D1e olddefconfig


will work to sanity check.

Kconfig has worked like that for a long time, but I do not know
how to detect non-existing symbols.

For renaming, I agree with you.
All defconfig files should be updated to keep the equivalent behavior.

For code removal, defconfig cleaning can be deferred because
that would possibly cause conflicts across subsystems.

Reusing the same CONFIG name for different meaning must be
sorted out properly but that rarely happens, I guess.
