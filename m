I think that it is too far fetched to attempt and expose UAPI headers
for some obscure char device that we are all know won't be around in
a couple of years from now due to the nature of how this embedded world
works.

More on that, the whole purpose of proposed interface is to debug and
not intended to be used by any user space code.

Also the idea that you are creating new bus just for this device doesn't
really sound right. I recommend you to take a look on auxiliary bus and
use it or come with very strong justifications why it is not fit yet.

I'm sorry to say, but this series is not ready to be merged yet.
