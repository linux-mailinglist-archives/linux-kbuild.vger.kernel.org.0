Hi Nick,

Yes, I can definitely add that.

This was actually the original approach, but I simplified it -- there
is no need to put them on their own.

Unless, of course, what you want is shorter verbose output -- is this
what you are referring to?

I am mimicking what we do for the checkers etc., since that is the
closest to Clippy.

`RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP` is used to be able to use stable releases of the
compiler with unstable features (it should go away, eventually).

Sounds good. In any case, I will check with upstream Rust if they are
used (or planned to be used) for any optimization purposes even before
LLVM is reached.

No, it cannot. This is actually a topic I brought up at LPC. Ideally,
we would get `rustc` to support similar command line flags as GCC and
Clang do to customize the targets.

The good news are that it seems upstream may be open to accept flags
to customize targets. They may use it as a way to stabilize parts of
the custom target spec piece by piece, instead of stabilizing the
custom target spec files.

We also raised the issue at the Rust CTCFT meeting a couple of weeks ago.

Not exactly -- in the Rust case, it is a (Rust) panic. So it would be
closer to `-fno-sanitize-recover`.

> A rust panic or a kernel panic?

The former -- which currently means `BUG()`. However, there could
perhaps be other alternatives. There was a bit of discussion about
this around Kangrejos time but nothing conclusive.

I don't have a strong opinion -- but I have not heard from others either...

Regarding `randconfig`, we could restrict it, no?

Yeah, there are also some factoring out that I could do. I grew the
file over time and while I am using target-specific variables to
generalize a bit too, it can still be taken further.

I have some other changes planned to the build process, so I will
probably take the chance to clean up a bit as well.

Yes, we have brought this up to upstream, for instance in the Rust
CTCFT meeting: https://rust-lang.github.io/ctcft/meetings/2021-11-22.html

In general, I track all feature requests etc. in this "live" issue
(see also the linked ones from there):
https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux/linux/issues/2

> Do we denote the conflict in KCONFIG?

No, but yeah, we could. However, I am not sure if we want to denote
them for something so experimental, though (another question is
whether we warn the user about GCC+Rust builds in general).

Or, if we are going to be serious about GCC already (i.e. before we
have actual codegen through GCC for Rust), then I would say we need a
better solution to the problem (like the "check-if-correct" approach
you suggested a while ago, or a proper GCC backend for `bindgen`).

Hmm... is there any possibility that we silence something that we care
actually about? I guess we would get the same diagnostics in normal
Clang/LLVM builds, so maybe it is fine. And even if not, perhaps we
should just simplify anyway, given it is GCC+Rust builds we are
talking about.

No particular reason. When the list of archs started to grow, I
decided it would be better to start splitting them out. I will clean
that out.

> This doesn't accidentally export non-GPL symbols as GPL does it?

It does, but that is fine -- it is the other way around the one that
would "open" the kernel unexpectedly.

Thanks a lot for the throughout review!

Cheers,
Miguel
