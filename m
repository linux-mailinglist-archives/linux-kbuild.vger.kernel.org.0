Sorry for not explaining this in my email.

I just thought I had fixed all the warnings,
at least the ones previously reported in linux-next:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220602092809.04008a86@canb.auug.org.au/

Sorry, I did not notice this.
It did not show up in allmodconfig test.
tick_nohz_full_setup() is only compiled when CONFIG_NO_HZ_FULL=y.

I rely on the 0day bot for randconfig tests, but I did not get the report.


Sorry about that.

I can send a patch.
