I can review this series from the build system point of view,
but I am not familiar enough with live-patching itself.

Some possibilities:

[1] Merge this series thru the live-patch tree after the
    kbuild base patches land.
    This requires one extra development cycle (targeting for 5.5-rc1)
    but I think this is the official way if you do not rush into it.

[2] Create an immutable branch in kbuild tree, and the live-patch
    tree will use it as the basis for queuing this series.
    We will have to coordinate the pull request order, but
    we can merge this feature for 5.4-rc1

[3] Apply this series to my kbuild tree, with proper Acked-by
    from the livepatch maintainers.
    I am a little bit uncomfortable with applying patches I
    do not understand, though...
