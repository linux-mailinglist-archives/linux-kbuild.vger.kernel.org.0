I agree with Blaise on both the issue of iterating through the eBPF
program as well as calling into EXPORT_SYMBOL'd functions; I see no
reason why these things couldn't be used in a LSM.  These are both
"public" interfaces; reading/iterating through the eBPF instructions
falls under a "don't break userspace" API, and EXPORT_SYMBOL is
essentially public by definition.

It is a bit odd that the eBPF code is creating an exported symbol and
not providing a declaration in a kernel wide header file, but that's a
different issue.

My understanding from the previous threads is that the recommendation
from the BPF devs was that anyone wanting to implement BPF program
signature validation at load time should implement a LSM that
leverages a light skeleton based loading mechanism and implement a
gatekeeper which would authorize BPF program loading based on
signatures.  From what I can see that is exactly what Blaise has done
with Hornet.  While Hornet is implemented in C, that alone should not
be reason for rejection; from the perspective of the overall LSM
framework, we don't accept or reject individual LSMs based on their
source language, we have both BPF and C based LSMs today, and we've
been working with the Rust folks to ensure we have the right things in
place to support Rust in the future.  If your response to Hornet is
that it isn't acceptable because it is written in C and not BPF, you
need to know that such a response isn't an acceptable objection.

I worry that we are now circling back to the original idea of doing
BPF program signature validation in the BPF subsystem itself.  To be
clear, I think that would be okay, if not ultimately preferable, but I
think we've all seen this attempted numerous times in the past and it
has been delayed, dismissed in favor of alternatives, or simply
rejected for one reason or another.  If there is a clearly defined
path forward for validation of signatures on BPF programs within the
context of the BPF subsystem that doesn't require a trusted userspace
loader/library/etc. that is one thing, but I don't believe we
currently have that, despite user/dev requests for such a feature
stretching out over several years.

I believe there are a few questions/issues that have been identified
in Hornet's latest round of reviews which may take Blaise a few days
(week?) to address; if the BPF devs haven't provided a proposal in
which one could acceptably implement in-kernel BPF signature
validation by that time, I see no reason why development and review of
Hornet shouldn't continue into a v3 revision.
