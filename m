They are not different from any other vendor, it is much cheaper and easier
to do not follow standard implementations.

It is different from the proposed /dev/surface... char device.

Yes, it is gross, IBM did it in early days of Linux. Other vendors don't
have anything like that.

I saw, the author misunderstood the Greg's comments.

It is one way, another is to take one device and create many small
devices out of it.

It is designed to replace invention of custom buses.

And who will rewrite it? My experience shows that right code should be
written from the beginning otherwise the code has too many chances to be
abandoned.
