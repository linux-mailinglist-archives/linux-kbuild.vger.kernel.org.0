Good then I really do not see a problem with this.

Correct.

Right, if we are going to use a misc chardev for this, then the
correct thing to do is to put the API bits for that chardev under
include/uapi.

It would still be good if you can provide a pointer to some userspace
tools using this new API; and for the next version maybe add that
pointer to the commit message

Hans
