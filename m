The only downside here is that the ARM/x86 accelerated shashes and the
generic shash now use the same core transform, right? Given that the
generic blake2s shash is never used for anything in the kernel, the
only reason for its existence was to be able to use the randomized
crypto testing infrastructure to test the arch code.

Ergo, there is no point in retaining the blake2s shashes and we can
simply remove all of them. (Note that blake2b is used as an shash via
the crypto API by btrfs, but blake2s is only used via the library API)
