thanks.  Fixing the non-functional things is obviously a good thing.

Iff we'd like to be able to call debian/rules directly, do we really
have to remember DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH, or just DEB_HOST_ARCH?

In the latter case, might this be a sufficient way to allow calling
debian/rules again?

diff --git a/scripts/package/debian/rules b/scripts/package/debian/rules
index 3dafa9496c63..e3e0001e7556 100755

 ifneq (,$(filter-out parallel=1,$(filter parallel=%,$(DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS))))
     NUMJOBS = $(patsubst parallel=%,%,$(filter parallel=%,$(DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS)))


... but the more I think about it, I am not convinced that we want to
use the debian/arch file.  Actually I think it would be nice if we
strive for an architecture independent source package instead of
engraving the architecture even more.


Nevertheless, your patch looks good to me.

Kind regards,
Nicolas
