The idea crossed my mind too [1], but sadly Clippy disables some
optimizations and in general is not intended to be used for normal
compilation [2].

Putting them in `MRPROPER_FILES` would mean only those in a given
directory are removed (e.g. the root one), but the idea here is to
find them anywhere in the tree, since in the future we may have
library crates in different parts of the tree.

However, I am not sure I understand your first question in relation
with the second one -- if we put them in `MRPROPER_FILES`, that would
remove less, not more.

The idea here is to document the differences (e.g. `RUSTFMT`) and that
we may have other targets in the future that do not apply to C (e.g.
MIR dump, if that happens to be useful).

But maybe I can fit that in the normal place and make it still look
good... I will give it a try.

It is not a conventional suffix at all as far as I am aware.

Maybe we should use a different one to aid editors and users anyway,
e.g. `.rsi`, similar to `.mi` for Objective-C `.m` files.

The macro expanded output is not intended to be used as a compilable
input, but as a debugging aid only. I can note this there.

Having said that, `rustc` accepts the "preprocessed" output in the
sense that it will just treat them as normal source files (no flag
needed, and e.g. both `.i` and `.rsi` work); however, it may give new
diagnostics or may require extra flags to enable some compiler
features.

From a quick test, I managed to compile a "preprocessed" Rust kernel
module with only command-line changes. But if we really wanted to
support this, we would need to ask upstream Rust to actually support
it.

> Are these two kconfigs used anywhere?

Not for the moment, but it could still be useful when getting
`.config` reports (and we could add it to `LINUX_COMPILER` etc. in the
future).

`-Cdebuginfo=` is the one; by default there is no debug info and that
option enables it (i.e. it is not just the level but the enablement
too).

(Note that in userspace, when compiling a common program, you will get
some debug info coming from the standard library and other
dependencies).

Thanks! I thought Rust would be a nice option for writing hostprogs,
though of course for the moment only programs that can assume Rust is
there may use it.

Note that non-x86 specific options need to be handled properly still
(e.g. move things between the arch Makefiles and the hostprog as
needed).

I would still want to see compilers come to some kind of common format
for this as we discussed other times, but... :)

Currently, `rustc` does not add a `.comment` section; but we could
ask, I sent [3].

If debug info is enabled, another way is using the `DW_AT_language`
attribute, like `pahole` will be doing for a new option we need [4].
However, we would still need a way for the other case.

In any case, I am not sure something like `.comment` is less or more
brittle -- compilers could in theory change it (e.g. not emitting it),
while adding a symbol is something we control. So different kinds of
brittleness.
