Which to me reads as "if you want a user-space interface for development and
debugging, you'll have to make it a stable interface, regardless where it is
implemented". Rather making a point for a well though-out stable interface.
Specifically with regards to

    "

     Yes.
    "

Unless of course I'm misunderstanding things entirely. Greg, please feel free
to yell at me if I've got this wrong.

Unless you know something that I don't, MS is rumored to come out with a new
Surface Pro 8 and Surface Laptop 4 early next year, which I fully expect to
also have this EC built in. And if they once again decided to move some
functionality normally provided via ACPI or other means to the EC for some
reason, we'll likely need that interface again.

Yes, it has no future outside of Surface devices, but so has every other
platform driver with respect to their specific platform. What are your
alternatives to exposing a user API? If we want to be able to easily test
and attempt to provide support for Surface devices, there has to be some
interaction with user-space.

With respect to stability of the interface and future changes, I believe
that IOCTLs are the way to go. If that's in debugfs or, as was the
result from the previous discussion about this, via a misc-device...
I'll be happy to implement whatever a consensus yields, as long as it
can be used for its intended purpose: aid development with regards to
the EC found on Surface devices.

Regards,
Max
