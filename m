Davids, can one of you respond to this?

I don't think it matters whether *Kbuild* can generate one file or
two.  If somebody follows the *Debian* document, they will have
two files.  It would surely be desirable that if somebody has followed
the Debian instructions that we would then sign the kernel using the
keys they previously generated.

I did read that commit.  I think it's a terrible idea.  If the
secret key & the certificate are stored in the same file, it's
no better than a symmetric cipher.  Not even SSH does this!
