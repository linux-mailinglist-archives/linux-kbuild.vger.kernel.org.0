As per previous discussion (https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/9/24/96) I have
replaced the debugfs device by a misc-device with stable interface.

I also believe that this is probably the better option long-term. The
general idea is to have a device that has direct access to the
EC/transport protocol and can be used for development and prototyping.
Debugging is a part of that. So it's more akin to something raw access
via i2cdev, hidraw, or raw access to USB devices as Hans de Goede
mentioned in one of his mails. Note that the module must still be loaded
manually

Max
