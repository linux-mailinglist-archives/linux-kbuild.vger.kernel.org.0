So far this is not possible with bootm, no. But if we can add
extensions to the FIT spec, then it should be possible to implement
this.

Is it (or will it be) possible to get Linux to build the DT + overlay
combinations?

The ramdisk is handled by the FIT configuration. I suppose it would be
possible to add a way to bypass the logic in select_ramdisk(), but I
wonder what is the use case for this?

I do have thoughts about a possible new FIT feature to allow external
files, which could perhaps include an initrd.
