 The onus is on the patch submitter to justify a change I'm afraid, and 
not the reviewer to chase such justification.  A change is supposed to be 
self-contained and straightforward to understand for someone reasonably 
familiar with the matters covered though not necessarily with the specific 
issue.  And this change is missing such self-contained justification I'm 
afraid.

 You need to make it easy for the reviewer to accept a change.  If a 
reviewer looks at the proposed change itself, reads through the associated 
description and immediately knows what is going on and that the change is 
good, the this is a good submission.

 Renaming a file does not cause the link order to automatically change 
(although I can imagine a build system where that happens).  And we're not 
talking about static initialisers and their implicit dependencies that 
might be hard to follow.

 We just have pairs of symbols that need to appear in a specific order in 
the link, and this is quite straightforward to control, by placing 
platform files earlier on the linker's invocation line, followed by arch 
files, followed by generic files.  That's certainly been defined linker's 
behaviour, especially as tools had to rely on it in more complex build 
systems before weak symbols were invented.

 That is perhaps a worthwhile improvement, but does not appear to have
anything to do with LLVM and its bug in handling the EXTERN linker script 
command.  Let's not mix up things.

 Also IIUC this will result in a code bloat: previously objects providing 
fallback symbols were not pulled from archives if not needed, whereas now 
they will always be and will remain permanently unused, wasting memory at 
run time.  So this looks to me like a (gratuitous) pessimisation.

 Then a comment at the fallback implementation should be enough.  Besides 
you need to be somewhat familiar with code you want to work with and Linux 
has always been terse in code annotations and relied on code being 
self-explanatory instead.
