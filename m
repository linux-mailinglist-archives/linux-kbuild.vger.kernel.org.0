This is not for an embedded device, but for the popular line of
Microsoft Surface laptops / 2-in-1s...

The purpose is to provide raw access to the Surface Serial Hub protocol,
just like we provide raw access to USB devices and have hidraw devices.

So this goes a litle beyond just debugging; and eventually the choice
may be made to implement some functionality with userspace drivers,
just like we do for some HID and USB devices.

Still I agree with you that adding new userspace API is something which
needs to be considered carefully. So I will look at this closely when
reviewing this set.

AFAIK the auxiliary bus is for sharing a single device between multiple
drivers, while the main device-driver also still offers functionality
(beyond the providing of access) itself.

This is more akin to how the WMI driver also models different WMI
functions as a bus + devices on the bus.

Or how the SDIO driver multiplex a single SDIO device into its
functions by again using a bus + devices on the bus model.

Also this has been in the works for quite a while now, the Linux on
Microsoft Surface devices community has been working on this out of
tree for a long time, see:
https://github.com/linux-surface/

And an RFC and a v1 have been posted a while ago, while auxiliary
bus support is not even in the mainline kernel yet. I would agree
with you that this should switch to auxiliary bus, despite the timing,
if that would lead to much better code. But ATM I don't really see
switching to auxiliary bus offering much benefits here.

See above, I believe that this all is a bit harsh and I have not
really heard convincing arguments for not merging this.

Moreover such a quick nack does not really promote working upstream,
where as we actually want people to work upstream as much as possible.
I know this is not a reason for taking bad code, but I'm not
convinced that this is bad code.

I have not reviewed this myself yet, but once I have reviewed
this and any review remarks have been addressed I do expect to
merge this series through the platform-drivers-x86 tree.
