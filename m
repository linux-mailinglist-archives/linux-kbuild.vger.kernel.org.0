Nit: Your signed-off-by ended up below the fold, was it in your cover
letter commit rather than your actual commit?

Aside from the relatively minor comments below, this looks like a really
good improvement to the documentation to me. It feels like it is more
targeting users or non-kbuild folks now, which I think is great.

I trust you to address my comments as you see fit, so please carry
forward:

This should probably have ARCH=s390?

I like the example as I feel like it addresses some of the fear I have had
around recommending LLVM=1 as the initial build suggestion but 'LLVM=1
LD=ld.bfd CROSS_COMPILE=s390x-linux-gnu-' does not compose as you describe here
because $(LD) is not prefixed with $(CROSS_COMPILE) anywhere in Makefile. The
non-$(LLVM) default assignment of $(LD) is '$(CROSS_COMPILE)ld' and that is
overridden by 'LD=ld.bfd' on the command line.

In other words, this should be

  make ARCH=s390 LLVM=1 LD=s390x-linux-gnu-ld.bfd

and have the note about CROSS_COMPILE prefixing any GNU toolchain utilities
removed. It should problably have OBJCOPY and OBJDUMP too, as those are
required due to https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/linux/issues/859 and
https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/linux/issues/1530.

Thanks a lot for documenting this behavior, it is one of the most common
issues I run into myself (adding LLVM_IAS=0 without CROSS_COMPILE) and
maybe this note will be what I need in order to remember :)

Maybe make a note of why this matters? ", which should lower kernel
build times compared to non-optimized LLVM toolchains."?
