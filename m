You are saying that sometimes having "best" evaluated to non zero
yields incorrect results, where the symbol found is actualy not a .text
symbol for a text address? If so, is this really true for cases where
no stripping is used? If so this is bigger news and I'd like to address
this separately in another commit but we need proof, not just
speculation.

And you seem to be suggesting that this seems to hold more true when
"--strip-unneeded" is used given there are fewer symbols left after
striping?

Did I comprehend what you are trying to say correctly?

OK.

OK so there is no issue when stripping is used.

OK then we need to take care your added heuristics do not affect
non-stripping.

You should be explicit about this in your commit log.

When you submit a v2 patch and you change something like that you must
clarify changes which are not clear either in the commit log or below
the --- lines after the diffstat and before the actual patch. Each new
patch iteration should have a set of bullets with all the changes you
have made so that the maintainer can track what you have done
differently on each iteration.

Right now you are not making any of this easy on me so I ask that you
stop submitting new patches willy nilly until we have actualy discussed
each item, and we decide what to do. I also ask that you keep track of
each change you are making on each new patch iteration on the patch
after the --- lines and before the patch, so I can easily tell all the
changes you have made on each new iteration.
