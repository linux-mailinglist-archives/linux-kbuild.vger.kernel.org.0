I am not sure I understand what you mean here. With the series as it is
or Kees's suggested fix, oldconfig still prompts the user to enable
CONFIG_CFI with CONFIG_CFI_CLANG=y in the old configuration. Both Miguel
and I allude to that being fine but it would be really nice if users
with CONFIG_CFI_CLANG=y were automatically transitioned to CONFIG_CFI=y
without any action on their part. That seems to be in line with how
Linus feels even as recently as this past merge window:

https://lore.kernel.org/CAHk-=wgO0Rx2LcYT4f75Xs46orbJ4JxO2jbAFQnVKDYAjV5HeQ@mail.gmail.com/

Another idea I had to avoid this is introducing CONFIG_CFI_GCC as a user
selectable symbol and making CONFIG_CFI the hidden symbol that both
compiler symbols select. After a couple of releases (or maybe the next
LTS), both CONFIG_CFI_CLANG and CONFIG_CFI_GCC could be eliminated with
CONFIG_CFI becoming user selectable, which would keep things working
since CONFIG_CFI=y will be present in the previous configuration.

Maybe it is not worth optimizing for this situation. I personally check
my configurations into git so that it is easy to deal with losing
things, as I have had my networking broken several times by new symbols
and dependencies that do not get handled well with olddefconfig.
