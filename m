Thinking more about this after Fangrui commented on the clang patch
above, using scan-build with GCC as the compiler is going to be hard to
support, as we are basically trying to support using two different
compilers with a unified set of '-f' flags, which I see as problematic
for a few reasons.

1. It restricts our ability to do cc-option cleanups like Nick did.

We should be eliminating cc-option calls that we know are specific to
one compiler because checking the Kconfig variables (CONFIG_CC_IS_...)
is much cheaper than invoking the compiler.

2. Necessary GCC specific flags will get dropped.

Adding back the call to cc-option will allow the build to succeed but it
drops the flag from KBUILD_CFLAGS. If there were ever a time where an
'-f' flag was needed to get a working kernel with GCC, it would not get
added because clang would reject it.

We already have a static-analyzer target that requires using CC=clang so
I think there is some precedent here to say we require the kernel to be
built with clang to use the static analyzer. The fact that it did prior
to 7d73c3e9c514 can just be chalked up to luck.

$ make -j"$(nproc)" LLVM=1 defconfig bindeb-pkg static-analyzer

would be the equivalent command to the original patch.

You can still use scan-build with the '--use-cc=clang' flag, which will
use clang for the compilation and analysis, if you so prefer.

Masahiro and Nick may have further thoughts and I am open to other
opinions but my vote is to say this is an issue we won't fix or
workaround.

Cheers,
Nathan
