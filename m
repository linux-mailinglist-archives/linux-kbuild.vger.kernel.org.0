So you did build without engine support ...

Well, not really: openssl is highly configurable and if it gets
configured wrongly, stuff like this happens.  That's why distros have a
fairly inclusive configuration and they stick to it.  No-one can cope
with the combinatoric explosion of openssl configuration possibilities
(even though they have ifdefs for most of them) so the only way is
really to fix a standard configuration and assume you're building for
it.

Openssl has been talking for ages about removing engine support, but
they've been unable to do so due to the rather slow pace of conversion
of their own engines.  I anticipate this code can be removed in favour
of the pkcs11 provider long before openssl actually manages to remove
engines.
