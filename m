It is up to Luis Chamberlain.

The original patch does not exist in my kbuild tree.
(and I was not even not CC'ed, so I had not noticed it
before I saw this report)

    module: Ignore RISC-V mapping symbols too

    RISC-V has an extended form of mapping symbols that we use to encode
    the ISA when it changes in the middle of an ELF.  This trips up modpost
    as a build failure, I haven't yet verified it yet but I believe the
    kallsyms difference should result in stacks looking sane again.
