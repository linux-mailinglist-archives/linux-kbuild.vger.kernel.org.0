What specifically makes a driver a "VFIO driver"?  Maybe that it
supports the VFIO ioctls in include/uapi/linux/vfio.h?  That by itself
doesn't require special treatment by the kernel, so I think there's
more here.

Do the other bus types have a flag analogous to
PCI_ID_F_VFIO_DRIVER_OVERRIDE?  If we're doing something similar to
other bus types, it'd be nice if the approach were similar.

Can we just name the specific driver instead of obliquely referring to
"the only such driver", e.g., something like "... add a modules.alias
entry for vfio_pci.ko, currently the only PCI VFIO driver"?

IIUC, the end result of this is basically a tweak to the existing
sysfs driver_override functionality.

And I *think* (correct me if I'm wrong), this actually has nothing in
particular to do with VFIO.  It's just that you want to expose some
device IDs that are only used for binding when driver_override is set.

So far, I think this is all the existing behavior, unaffected by this
patch.

And this patch basically adds this modules.alias entry.

Previously vfio_pci contained no vendor/device IDs, and the only way
to bind it to a device was to either:

  - Modprobe the driver and write dynamic device IDs to the driver's
    /sys/.../new_id.  This should directly bind the driver to all
    devices that match the new IDs (see new_id_store()).

or

  - Write "vfio_pci" to the device's /sys/.../driver_override.
    AFAICS, this won't bind anything (see driver_override_store()),
    but if we call the driver's .probe() method via modprobe or
    rescan, the driver_override will match any device regardless of
    ID.

IIUC, after this patch, you can add vendor/device IDs to a struct
pci_driver with this new flag.  These IDs are advertised via
modules.alias.

For driver binding, IDs with the new flag are eligible to match only
when driver_override is set to the matching driver.

Setting a device's driver_override has *always* caused the matching
driver to bind.  The only difference after this patch is that now we
give the driver an ID from its .id_table instead of pci_device_id_any.

I assume somewhere in here you need to unbind mlx5_core before binding
mlx5_vfio_pci?

Don't you need something here to trigger the driver attach, i.e.,
should step 5 and step 6 be swapped?  What if the driver is already
loaded?  Can you modprobe again to make it bind to a second device?

s/buses's/buses/

I see drivers/vfio/platform/vfio_platform.c; is that what you mean?  I
don't see any VFIO things with ACPI in their name, so maybe I'm
looking the wrong place.  If this is purely *plans* for the future,
maybe say something like "planned VFIO drivers ..."

Ah, thanks.  I was thinking this added something to /sys/.../modalias,
but sounds like that's not the case.
