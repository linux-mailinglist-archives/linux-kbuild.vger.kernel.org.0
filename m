This breaks building kernels with an m68k-uclinux-gcc toolchain that have
modules configured. Before this change they built and ran fine.
They build and run fine if CONFIG_MODULES is not set.

A few hundred errors like this spew out:

     scripts/mod/modpost -o Module.symvers -T modules.order vmlinux.o
     ERROR: modpost: vmlinux: .export_symbol section references '', but it does not seem to be an export symbol
     ERROR: modpost: vmlinux: .export_symbol section references '', but it does not seem to be an export symbol
     ERROR: modpost: vmlinux: .export_symbol section references '', but it does not seem to be an export symbol
     ...

This is still broken all the way through to the current 6.6-rc7, though the error
messages are slightly better:

     ERROR: modpost: vmlinux: local symbol 'system_state' was exported
     ERROR: modpost: vmlinux: local symbol 'static_key_initialized' was exported
     ERROR: modpost: vmlinux: local symbol 'reset_devices' was exported
     ...

I tried a bunch of different binutils and gcc versions (binutils-2.251 through
2.40 and gcc versions 8.3.0 through 12.3.0). If I compile with an m68k-linux
targeted toolchain then it works - no modpost processing problems.

nm reports the same information for symbols in both cases, eg:

$ m68k-uclinux-nm vmlinux.o | grep system_state
00000000 r __export_symbol_system_state
00000008 B system_state
0000000c d __UNIQUE_ID___addressable_system_state320

$ m68k-linux-nm vmlinux.o | grep system_state
00000000 r __export_symbol_system_state
00000008 B system_state
0000000c d __UNIQUE_ID___addressable_system_state320

Tracing in scripts/mod/modpost.c I see that for this symbol example
("system_state") that ELF_ST_BIND(sym->st_info) is 0x0 for the
m68k-uclinux toolchain case, so STB_LOCAL, whereas for the m68k-linux
case it is 0x1, so STB_GLOBAL.

Any idea what is going on here?

Greg
