When you report a regression in the kernel code in the future,
please try to do "git bisect" and pin-point an offending commit.

That is more helpful to figure out how to fix the issue.

And, you will be sure whether or not the root cause exists
in the kernel.

It depends on the environment whether or not dpkg-deb
spawns the external 'xz' command.


With WITH_LIBLZMA defined, dpkg-deb uses internal code
to compress the data with xz.  [1]

Without WITH_LIBLZMA, dpkg-deb sparns "xz" processes. [2]

ss.c?ref_type=3Dtags#L412

ss.c?ref_type=3Dtags#L663


Since you said you saw "xz" in the "ps" command output,
I believe your case is the latter.


When dpkg-deb swarns the external "xz" command,
dpkg-deb unsets "XZ_OPT". [3]

I believe that's why you do not see XZ_OPT propagated.

I do not think so.

There already exists a solution to control the number of threads.



See "man dpkg-deb"

   DPKG_DEB_THREADS_MAX
       Sets the maximum number of threads allowed for compressors that
       support multi=E2=80=90threaded operations (since dpkg 1.21.9).

       The --threads-max option overrides this value.




By setting this env variable, you should be able to control the multi-threa=
ding.


However, your dpkg-deb is 1.20.12, so you need to use a newer version.



You locally hacked builddeb to add --threads-max, but it does not
work for you for the same reason; it requires dpkg 1.21.9+


  --threads-max=3Dthreads
     Sets the maximum number of threads allowed for compressors that suppor=
t
     multi=E2=80=90threaded operations (since dpkg 1.21.9).




Why do you stick to the old home-built dpkg-deb?

If you use the default dpkg-deb bundled with Ubuntu 23.10,
you will have a better experience.

Or, if you still insist on a home-built dpkg-deb,
why don't you build a newer version?
