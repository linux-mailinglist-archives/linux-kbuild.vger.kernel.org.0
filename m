Could I get you to provide further detail as to why you consider my
reasons inadaquate?

The distribution is well-known.  I believe in-tree and out-of-tree build
mechanisms being as possible to each other is a Good Thing.

I guess I should also note, in the past (890676c65d699, 9da0763bdd825,
likely others) nicer build output has been sufficient justification for
changes.  An effect of the series is a leading "./" will disappear from
many files in full build output.  As such this also matches that reason.
