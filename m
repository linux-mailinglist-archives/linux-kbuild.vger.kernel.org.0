+--------------------------------------------------
+4.  Automatic conversion of unresolved relocations
+--------------------------------------------------
+Sometimes livepatches may operate on symbols which are not self-contained nor
+exported. When this happens, these symbols remain unresolved in the elf object
+and will trigger an error during the livepatch instantiation.
+
+Whenever possible, the kernel building infrastructure solves this problem
+automatically. First, a symbol database containing information on all compiled
+objects is built. Second, this database - a file named Symbols.list, placed in
+the kernel source root directory - is used to identify targets for unresolved
+relocations, converting them in the livepatch elf accordingly to the
+specifications above-described. While the first stage is fully handled by the
+building system, the second is done by a tool called klp-convert, which can be
+found in "scripts/livepatch".
+
+When an unresolved relocation has as target a symbol whose name is also used by
+different symbols throughout the kernel, the relocation cannot be resolved
+automatically. In these cases, the livepatch developer must add annotations to
+the livepatch, making it possible for the system to identify which is the
+correct target amongst multiple homonymous symbols. Such annotations must be
+done through a data structure as follows:
+
+struct KLP_MODULE_RELOC(object) data_structure_name[] = {
+	KLP_SYMPOS(symbol, pos)
+};
+
+In the above example, object refers to the object file which contains the
+symbol, being vmlinux or a module; symbol refers to the symbol name that will
+be relocated and pos is its position in the object.
+
+When a data structure like this is added to the livepatch, the resulting elf
+will hold symbols that will be identified by klp-convert and used to solve name
+ambiguities.
