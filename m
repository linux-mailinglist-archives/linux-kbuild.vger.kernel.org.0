Hum, I missed a part in refactoring (commit
f78e50c8f750c0ac6767ac1ed006360cf77c56c4). :/
Could you please test the following patch?

diff --git a/certs/blacklist.c b/certs/blacklist.c
index 07c592ae5307..f998a2e85ddc 100644
--- a/certs/blacklist.c

Is it possible to test these kind of dbx blacklist with Qemu?
