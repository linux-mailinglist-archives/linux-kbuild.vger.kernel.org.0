The PCI core does not require "at most 1 bit is set."

Actually, I don't think even the file2alias code requires that.  If
you set two bits, you can generate two aliases.

Yes, __u32 is fine and I'm only suggesting a comment change here.

I think it's fine to add the functionality in one patch and use it in
the next if it makes the commit clearer.  I wouldn't want to add
functionality that's not used at all in the series, but it's OK when
they're both posted together.
