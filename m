One reason might be certification. For certain industrial applications
like support for complex field bus protocols, you need to get your
devices tested by an external partner running extensive test suites.
This is time consuming and expensive. 

Changing the toolchain of your system then, would be a massive change
which would require recertification, while you could argue just
updating a single component like the kernel and building everything
again, does not require the whole testing process again. 

Thin ice, I know.

One problem we actually ran into in BSPs like that (we build with
ptxdist, however build system doesn't matter here, it could as well
have been buildroot etc.) was things* failing to build with newer
compilers, things we could not or did not want to fix, so staying with
an older toolchain was the obvious choice. 

*Things as in bootloaders for an armv5 platform.

Agreed.

What we actually did: building recent userspace and kernel with older
toolchains, because bootloader. I know, there are several
possibilities to solve this kind of lock:

- built bootloader with different compiler
- update bootloader
- â€¦

As said before, this is no problem for me now, I can work around it,
but to give an idea what could keep people on older toolchains.
