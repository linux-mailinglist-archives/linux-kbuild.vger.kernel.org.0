Utility functions such as string routines are intended to be used
anywhere on demand, not only in vmlinux but also in loadable
modules.

Therefore, such functions are very likely to be EXPORT_SYMBOL'ed.
As a matter of fact, most of the files listed in lib-y
contain EXPORT_SYMBOL.

Historically, static libraries did not work well with EXPORT_SYMBOL.

Originally, lib-y dropped functions that had no callsite in vmlinux, but
it was a wrong behavior. We must always keep exported functions, which
might be used by modules, even if not by vmlinux.

7f2084fa55e6cb61f61b4224d4a8bafaeee55f9f
added a workaround so that all of EXPORT_SYMBOL
are considered "referenced".

Since then, most of lib-y objects were linked anyway,
given the following:

- Most of *.c files listed in lib-y contain at least one EXPORT_SYMBOL
- In static library, if any one of symbol is referenced, the entire object
  is linked

So, lib-y was not helpful for reducing the kernel image size.

The exceptional cases are CONFIG_MODULES=n
or CONFIG_TRIM_UNUSED_KSYMS=y, but neither of
them is a common use-case.

To remove unused functions,
CONFIG_LD_DEAD_CODE_DATA_ELIMINATION (per-symbol
removal) seems to be a more sensible solution to me.
