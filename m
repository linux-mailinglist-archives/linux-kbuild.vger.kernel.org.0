Sure! Sorry, I totally forgot that I needed to do that manually since b4 
doesn't know about rust->C relations...

If a generic type is instantiated from different crates (e.g. kernel 
crate and a driver), it creates separate Location objects. But we also 
have a bigger problem: this breaks module unload, since that leaves lock 
classes dangling. Though that is yet another discussion to have (Rust's 
lifetime semantics kind of break down when you can unload modules!).

Maybe we can just make it a spinlock? The critical section is very short 
for lock classes that already exist (just iterating over the hash 
bucket, which will almost always be length 1), so it's probably more 
efficient to do that than use a mutex anyway. Lockdep itself uses a 
single global spinlock for a bunch of stuff too.

For the new class case it does do an allocation, but I think code 
probably shouldn't be creating locks and things like that with 
preemption disabled / in atomic context? That just seems like a recipe 
for trouble... though this ties into the whole execution context story 
for Rust, which we don't have a terribly good answer for yet, so I think 
it shouldn't block this approach. The macro style lock creation 
primitives still exist for code that really needs the static behavior.
