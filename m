IMO, software nodes were introduced to add sub-properties to the existing
firmware nodes, but it has usecase/potential to go beyond that. More below.

Sometimes you do not have any DT node at all. For example, in this series, the
M.2 pwrseq driver creates the serdev software device for the M.2 BT card to
match it with the existing OF based BT driver (for non-M2 device). From the
driver's point of view, a BT device attached to the M.2 slot and over custom
connectors are both the same. Only difference is that, in the case of custom
connectors, the bluetooth DT node will have the BT device described and in the
case of M.2, the device won't get described, but just the connector [1]. But for
the driver to identify the device (since it cannot enumerate it), either it has
to rely on DT/ACPI or some other means.

In the previous version of this series [2], I used the serdev ID based on the
product name for creating the serdev device and added a new id_table for serdev
driver to match with the device [3]. This almost duplicated the existing OF
match logic. Then Bartosz suggested to use swnode approach [4], to get rid of
the custom serdev ID based matching. When I prototyped, it mostly worked well,
except that swnode needed to have its own .device_get_match_data(), match() and
uevent/modalias functions. And if the swnode reused the existing DT compatible
string, it can work with the existing BT driver without modifications. And this
approach can also be extended to devices instantiated from the board specific
drivers.

Yes I did. I didn't put the above justification in the cover letter, as it was
already overwhelmed with too much information regarding the connector node.
Maybe I should've added it in the comments section of this patch. But I didn't
know how to do that with b4.
