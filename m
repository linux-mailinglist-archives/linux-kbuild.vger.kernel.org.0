Uhh ... it does now.  It didn't when I originally wrote this patch.
Apparently it was updated in November:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=989463

The patch only does this because you asked it to be changed to do this!
Look back at the version I originally sent out.  It didn't generate
the module signing key at all.  I had no idea the kernel build was even
capable of doing such a thing until you pointed it out.

I followed the instructions in the Debian document *that existed at
the time* (and now apparently we can't see because Debian uses an
inept type of wiki that can't show old versions).  I generated a key
and did not store it in the build tree.  I enrolled that key.
And then I thought "It would be nice if I didn't have to do all this
manual work after installing a new kernel so that my machine would
boot".

And here we are, months later, and you're complaining about ...
something?
