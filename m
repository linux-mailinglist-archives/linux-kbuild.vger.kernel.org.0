I don't think so, files in drivers/misc/* don't have such strict policy.

There is a huge difference between char device for the debug and
exposed UAPI header. The first requires from the user to build and
explicitly run it, while header allows to reliably build on top of
it various applications that we don't control. The not-break-rule
talks about the second.

Because you are actually making life harder for everyone who cares about
UAPIs exposed by the Linux and they definitely different in numbers from
those who needs debug interface for the Microsoft Surface board.
