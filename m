I don't think it's worth having two separate #defines.  If we need
more in the future, we can add them when we need them.

What if we renamed "flags" to be specifically for this override case,
e.g., "override_only"?  Then the flag could be
PCI_ID_F_VFIO_DRIVER_OVERRIDE, which would trigger a "vfio_" prefix in
file2alias.c, but pci_match_device() could just check for it being
non-zero, without caring whether the reason is VFIO or something else,
e.g.,

  pci_match_device(...)
  {
    ...
    if (found_id->override_only) {
      if (dev->driver_override)
        return found_id;
      ...
