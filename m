Potential doesn't mean the necessity.

Yes, that is exactly the case I have referred to. The PCI core (in Linux)
is able to create DT subtree on non-OF based platforms.

So, what's the problem to add such a description? (Assuming you want a customisation
it can be done at run-time, correct?)

Yes.

That's how we do when we want to add a board file, but thing is that we do not
want board files (only in the cases when other ways are impossible or make less
sense).

I know that Bart is fan of swnodes, but it should not be used as a silver
bullet, really.

DT overlay should work without even modifications done to swnode code, right?

Then you missed it. The cover letter for such a change is way too short.
