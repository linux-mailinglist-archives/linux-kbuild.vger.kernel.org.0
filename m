Good point. Thanks.

But I did not notice any regression on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS system, and neither on
the Ubuntu 22.10 Mantic system which was upgraded. So I assumed it was not related to
particular commit, and I did not think of bisect.

Thanks for your insight. It is obviously a compile-time define.

In previous build the defaults were apparently different. The Debian defaulting to multi-threaded
dpkg-deb was the exact reason why I did the hand build in the first place.

In the long run, it saved an awful lot of time.

But I can't see the logic of enforcing the single-threaded "xz" from dpkg-deg :-/

Your insight really casts light on this. Now it is very clear.

But IMHO single-threaded 30-min xz compression on a 16-core or 32-SMT machine is kind of weird.
I wish there was something we could do about it.

The same happened with the rpmbuild with similar defaults on Fedora. :-(

Yes, but I did it because Ubuntu dpkg-deb was single-threaded by default. I did not
know so many kbuild options at the time ...

That's a good idea. But with Debian defaults, I suppose :-)

Thank you for all your insight you provided, it really cleared a lot of dubious things.

Except that I thought I saw "XZ_OPT=-T0" in "ps xewww" environment listing of the xz
process itself. But right now I cannot access that box until Monday, so I rest my case.

IMHO, the build process should have optimal defaults. This would eventually reduce the
load on the kbuild developers and maintainers, and increase overall user satisfaction.

I will do what it takes, but for the real Linux newbies maybe it would be more user-friendly
to have the build system use all the cores out-of-the-box. But maybe not.

There might be some cons to this, dunno. This way it is certainly more mystery ;-)

Thanks again, and have a blessed weekend!
