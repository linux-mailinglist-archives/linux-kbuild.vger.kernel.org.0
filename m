Yes.

I do not see a sensible reason in the previous quirk

I am curious about how to use bsearch() if the whole implementation
is short, but I could not understand that logic fully.

You are right. I missed the fact that grab_file() used mmap.

I am OK with the careful check.

Yet another possible alternative is, as Nick suggested, cut the first loop.
Use realloc() to grow the array as needed, but this is also suboptimal
if memory copy occurs.

Understood.
With mid =3D lo + (hi - lo) / 2,
the last sentinel is never set as mid.
