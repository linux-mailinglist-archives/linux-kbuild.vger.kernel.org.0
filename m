Right.

We would end up with such situations because applying
an overlay does not change the compatible string.



With this code in arch/arm64/boot/dts/ti/Makefile:

k3-am642-tqma64xxl-mbax4xxl-sdcard-dtbs :=3D \
      k3-am642-tqma64xxl-mbax4xxl.dtb k3-am64-tqma64xxl-mbax4xxl-sdcard.dtb=
o
k3-am642-tqma64xxl-mbax4xxl-wlan-dtbs :=3D \
      k3-am642-tqma64xxl-mbax4xxl.dtb k3-am64-tqma64xxl-mbax4xxl-wlan.dtbo




$ fdtdump  arch/arm64/boot/dts/ti/k3-am642-tqma64xxl-mbax4xxl-sdcard.dtb
2>/dev/null| head -n15 | tail -n2
    model =3D "TQ-Systems TQMa64xxL SoM on MBax4xxL carrier board";
    compatible =3D "tq,am642-tqma6442l-mbax4xxl", "tq,am642-tqma6442l",
"ti,am642";


$ fdtdump  arch/arm64/boot/dts/ti/k3-am642-tqma64xxl-mbax4xxl-wlan.dtb
2>/dev/null| head -n15 | tail -n2
    model =3D "TQ-Systems TQMa64xxL SoM on MBax4xxL carrier board";
    compatible =3D "tq,am642-tqma6442l-mbax4xxl", "tq,am642-tqma6442l",
"ti,am642";





These two go into image.fit, but one of them is completely dead
since there is no way to distinguish them.


$ fdtdump  arch/arm64/boot/image.fit

        ...

        conf-10 {
            compatible =3D "tq,am642-tqma6442l-mbax4xxl",
"tq,am642-tqma6442l", "ti,am642";
            description =3D "TQ-Systems TQMa64xxL SoM on MBax4xxL carrier b=
oard";
            fdt =3D "fdt-10";
            kernel =3D "kernel";
        };

        ...

        conf-25 {
            compatible =3D "tq,am642-tqma6442l-mbax4xxl",
"tq,am642-tqma6442l", "ti,am642";
            description =3D "TQ-Systems TQMa64xxL SoM on MBax4xxL carrier b=
oard";
            fdt =3D "fdt-25";
            kernel =3D "kernel";
        };





I agree with Chen-Yu.

FIT should not include full DTBs.

Bootloaders should assemble the final DTB
from base and overlays on-the-fly.


The FIT spec allows the "fdt" property to list
multiple image nodes.


o config-1
 |- description =3D "configuration description"
 |- kernel =3D "kernel sub-node unit name"
 |- fdt =3D "fdt sub-node unit-name" [, "fdt overlay sub-node unit-name", .=
..]
 |- loadables =3D "loadables sub-node unit-name"
 |- script =3D "
 |- compatible =3D "vendor
