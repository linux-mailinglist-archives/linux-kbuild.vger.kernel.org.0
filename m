Any CALL instruction is a no-no. Only 'simple' code is allowed between
STAC and CLAC.

So in the case of that latest __always_inline patch, there was only a
single caller. New syntax would buy us absolutely nothing there.

If we're talking extentions, I'd much rather have function spaces. That
is, being able to tag functions *AND* function pointers with an address
space qualifier.

I want to be able to create a function pointer that can only be assigned
functions from the noinstr space for example. Ideally calling such a
functino pointer would only be possible from within that space.

Anyway, let me go read that blog you linked.
