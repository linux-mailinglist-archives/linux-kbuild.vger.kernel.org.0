But, this patch is doing different things than the Debian document.


The Debian document you referred to says:
  "Ubuntu puts its MOK key under /var/lib/shim-signed/mok/ and some
   software such as Oracle's virtualbox package expect the key there
   so we follow suit (see 989463 for reference) and put it at the same place"



In Debian, MOK is generated under /var/lib/shim-signed/mok/,
and its primary use is for signing the kernel.
Then, you can reuse it for signing modules as well.


This patch adopts the opposite direction:
  Kbuild generates the module signing key, then
  this patch reuses it for singing the kernel.

The key is located in the kernel build tree
(that is, the key is lost when you run "make mrproper").

You need to "mokutil --import path/to/module/sining/key"
every time Kbuild generates a new key.



So, another possible approach is:

builddeb signs the kernel with the key
in /var/lib/shim-signed/mok/.

I think this is more aligned with the debian documenation.

I added Ben Hutchings, who might give us insights.
