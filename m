Great, thank you!

I think we should just prevent the Kconfig option from being enabled if
the toolchain doesn't give us what we need. So there's no need to fail
compilation, but SCS =n. See how e.g. CONFIG_ARM64_BTI_KERNEL depends on
CONFIG_CC_HAS_BRANCH_PROT_PAC_RET_BTI.

As above, I think we should disable the feature in those cases.

Make sense?
