As far as I am aware, the 0day bot tests both compilers with W=1. I
think the more likely explanation is that the robot is not testing with
prerelease versions of GCC, which is currently 14.x, which is the only
version of GCC that has this warning implemented.

No, otherwise we wouldn't be adding it to W=1 ;)

I think the register storage issue should be resolved in at least clang
before this patch is accepted, as that seems to be where the majority of
warnings are coming from so far. Like we talked about, I'll take a shot
at fixing that. Once that is fixed, I'll build mainline with
-Wmissing-variable-declarations to see how many instances there are and
if there are any other interesting edge cases that should be fixed in
the compiler. After that, I think this should be good to go in. Does
that sound reasonable?

Cheers,
Nathan
