Why would you need to change the path later?

The SRPM has sources, it does not need to build on the system on which
it is authored if it is intended for another distribution.

Of course, you would need to know for what distribution and where it
wants its modules so that you can specify the location when creating the
SRPM.

That's good to know.

That's where every other library and module would go on distributions
that care about ability to install packages for multiple architectures
at the same time. AFAIK the workaround is to inclclude the CPU
architecture in extraversion for the kernel to fit.

That's unfortunate result of how the pkgconfig tool works. By now it is
even too late to complain to the tool author because it's been like that
forever, best bet is to to use it as is or pick a different tool for
configuration.

So far it has not been commented on. Maybe it's time for a ping.
