This module still needs to be loaded explicitly. And (I might be wrong
about this) the "not-break-user constraints" hold as soon as I register
a misc device at all, no? So I don't see how this is a) any different
than previously discussed with Greg and b) how the uapi header now
introduces any not-break-user constraints that would not be there
without it.

This interface is intended as a stable interface. That's something that
I committed to as soon as I decided to implement this via a misc-device.

Sure, I can move the definitions in the uapi header to the module
itself, but I don't see any benefit in that. If someone really wants to
use this interface, they can just as well copy the definitions from the
module source itself. So why not be upfront about it and make life
easier for everyone?

Regards,
Max
