Yes, you're correct. What I was trying to express was that this keeps
the build process the same as when `cc=3DHOSTCC` today, which while not
required is frequently true.

Rust unfortunately currently doesn't support invoking the linker
directly: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/73632
We work around this for kernel level code by manually providing
expected symbols/stubs normally injected by rustc during linking
because it is critical to use the kernel linking infrastructure there,
but this doesn't seem as important on host unless I've missed
something. While we could do that, it would add nontrivial complexity
for minimal gain.
A nontrivial chunk of rust/Makefile is currently spent working around
this lack of support for non-rustc-managed link stages.

As mentioned earlier, we could pass $HOSTLD, but if the linker isn't
named something accurate (e.g. if the linker is not named lld, but is
lld), we need to know how to pass a flavor:
https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/codegen-options/index.html#linker-flavor
Would it be appropriate to just assume the linker is named correctly?

This would not work correctly with my patch. Once we decide which of
the two linkage strategies we want (using $HOSTCC or $HOSTLD) I'll
send a new patch that forwards the flags along.

Oddly, the Android kernel environment (Kleaf) is the one that I needed
this patch to build in, but it seemed to be working without a manual
KBUILD_HOSTCFLAGS forwarding.

Overall, it sounds like you'd prefer if I set this to use
`KBUILD_HOSTLD` and `KBUILD_HOSTLDFLAGS`, and leave the linker flavor
to autodetect?
