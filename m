I want to know why this is useful.


To clarify my question, let me first explain
what the modversion is.



In C, a function callee and callers must agree
with the interface of the function.


This is usually done by having a function prototype
in a header file.


Say, we have a function declaration

    int foo(int x, int y);

in include/linux/foo.h


Then, the C file that defines foo() and all C files
that call it must include <linux/foo.h> so that
argument mismatch can be detected.




Same for EXPORT_SYMBOL; the symbol provider and consumers
must agree with the interface of exported symbols.

In the kernel, however, there is no promise for in-kernel ABI
compatibility across different kernel versions.
The kernel only promises the compatibility of the userspace interface.


To load modules, by principle, vmlinux and modules must have
the same version.

To slightly loosen the limitation, CONFIG_MODVERSIONS was
introduced; when it is enabled, you can load a module
as long as all the prototypes of exported symbols match.

To do this, we need to encode information about prototypes.


This is done by a tool called genksyms (scripts/genksyms/genksyms).



Say, we have this code:


int foo(int x, int y)
{
     // genksyms does not care about
     // the function body.
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo);


Genksyms parses the code and computes a CRC value for 'foo'.
Genksyms is only interested in the function name and its prototype.

It sees

   int foo(int, int)

and it transforms it into a CRC.


Any change to the prototype results in a
different CRC, so the module subsystem
can check the interface compatibility
before loading a module.


It is obvious that this is impossible for Rust source
because scripts/genksyms/genksyms is only able to
parse C code.


Then, what is happening here?

See rust/exports.c


  #define EXPORT_SYMBOL_RUST_GPL(sym) extern int sym; EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(sym=
)


The global scope symbols in Rust (i.e. 'pub) are automatically
exported, and all of them are visible as 'int' variables
from C world.


Genksyms will see this code:

  extern int foo;
  EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(foo);

Of course, this is not a true prototype.
The real signature on the Rust side might be:

  fn foo(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32


So, even if you enable CONFIG_MODVERSIONS,
nothing is checked for Rust.
Genksyms computes a CRC from "int foo", and
the module subsystem confirms it is a "int"
variable.

We know this check always succeeds.

Why is this useful?
