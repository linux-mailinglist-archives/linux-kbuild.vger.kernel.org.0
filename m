The way I did it previously was to hack Kbuild to not remove the temporary
files after a failure, and then compare the "objdump --syms" output of the
last two stages.

I suppose we could improve the situation if scripts/link-vmlinux.sh was able
to do that automatically, and compare the kallsyms output .S file between
steps 1 and 2.
