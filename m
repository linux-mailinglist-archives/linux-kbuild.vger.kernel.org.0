Well, boot-time gadgets aren't really a thing.  And, as you said,
libstub is in .init.text, so it gets freed (and presumably mapped
non-executable) during boot, so we don't have to worry about any gadgets
hanging around in memory after the fact.

That said, objtool also generates ORC metadata, so in addition to
security-type things, it also cares about any code that might show up on
a stack trace during a boot-time warning/oops.  So it *does* care about
.init.text code in that sense.

But IIUC, the libstub code runs *very* early, and wouldn't show up in a
stack trace anyway, because there are no traces of it on the stack once
it branches to head.S code (which doesn't save the link register).
