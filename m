Irrespective of how and which DTB files are built, I think it would help
if we could decouple the compatible string in the configuration node from
the compatible string in the DTB.

Many of the overlays currently in-tree are extensions of a given board,
enabling a certain feature. Same could be said for all the out-of-tree
Raspberry Pi overlays. Fundamentally it is still the same board, and
the DTB's compatible shouldn't change. However the compatible string
in the configuration node is only used by the firmware for selection
purposes. It could be much more expansive including the extension
features.

We could have an extra config file that lists DTB files to exclude from
the FIT image, and replacement compatible strings for the configuration
node for certain DTB files.

Using an in-tree example: instead of "gw,imx8mm-gw73xx-0x" mapping to
imx8mm-venice-gw73xx-0x-*.dtb in addition to the base DT file
imx8mm-venice-gw73xx-0x.dtb, each could be mapped to a different
extension compatible, so "gw,imx8mm-gw73xx-0x-imx219" would map to
imx8mm-venice-gw73xx-0x-imx219.dtb.

How these configuration compatible strings should be defined is another
matter...

I think this would help with selecting between the combined DTB vs base DTB
plus DTBO overlays, and perhaps automatic exclusion of combined DTBs when
board compatibles collide. But I do think device vendors and maintainers
would want the extra flexibility I illustrated above.
