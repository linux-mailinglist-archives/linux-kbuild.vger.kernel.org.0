The feature you refer to and the feature Masahiro is referring to are
two separate issues.  If you care to understand the issue Masahiro is
trying to fix, please take the time to read the full discussion:
https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/linux/issues/515 and particularly
https://reviews.llvm.org/D63564

Relying on link order is terribly brittle. Renaming a file can cause
your implementation to change, and ties your hands from ever using
things like LTO or newer build systems like ninja.  Static
initialization order is a plague to C and C++.  It's explicitly
undefined behavior you've just admitted you prefer to rely on.  (A
Google search for "static initialization order" wants to autocomplete
to "static initialization order fiasco" which is also an interesting
read; https://www.cryptopp.com/wiki/Static_Initialization_Order_Fiasco).

Masahiro is right that this case has some questionable choices in
terms of redefining symbols with different implementations.  I think
__HAVE_ARCH_STRCPY and friends in lib/string.c is actually the best
pattern for not providing multiple definitions of a symbol, followed
by marking symbols meant to be overridden at link time based on config
as __weak.  He's just trying to help clean this up.

That prom_meminit and prom_free_prom_memory are meant to be overridden
by other configs.
