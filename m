I don't think I was in that meeting. Anyway,

If you have a fallback when the allocation fails, that helps ...

You say that Location objects are not necessarily unique per file
location. In practice, how often are they not unique? Always just using
the Location object as a static lock class seems like it would
significantly simplify this proposal.

I do agree that there is value in being able to more easily detect
potential deadlocks involving destructors of ref-counted values. I once
had a case of that myself, though lockdep was able to catch it without
this change because it saw the refcount hit zero in the right place.
