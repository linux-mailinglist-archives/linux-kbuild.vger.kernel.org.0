In the use case of DTrace, tracing internal functions is certainly something
that is used, be it for debugging/performance analysis, for gaining better
understanding what internal operations are triggerd by userspace actions, etc.

DTrace supports arbitrary address probing based on an offset from a symbol.

While identifying a traced symbol is important, the use cases I am seeing are
the other way around... being able to specify a symbol name (with whatever
additional elements needed to make it unique) as target for placing a probe.
And doing so without needing to depend on DWARF data or other rather large
collection of debug data.  Especially on production systems, requiring the
typically very large debuginfo style data to be installed is not acceptable
for the use cases I encounter.
