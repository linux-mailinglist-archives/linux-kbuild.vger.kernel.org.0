> +	/// without checking that the value is not [`None`].

> +
> +    Please note that panicking should be very rare and used only with a good
> +    reason. In almost all cases, a fallible approach should be used, typically
> +    returning a ``Result``.
> +
> +  - If providing examples of usage would help readers, they must be written in
> +    a section called ``# Examples``.
> +
> +  - Rust items (functions, types, constants...) must be linked appropriately
> +    (``rustdoc`` will create a link automatically).
> +
> +  - Any ``unsafe`` block must be preceded by a ``// SAFETY:`` comment
> +    describing why the code inside is sound.
> +
> +    While sometimes the reason might look trivial and therefore unneeded, writing
> +    these comments is not just a good way of documenting what has been taken into

> +General Information
> +===================
> +
> +This document contains useful information to know when working with
> +the Rust support in the kernel.
> +
> +
> +Code documentation
> +------------------
> +
> +Rust kernel code is documented using ``rustdoc``, its built-in documentation
> +generator.
> +
> +The generated HTML docs include integrated search, linked items (e.g. types,
> +functions, constants), source code, etc. They may be read at (TODO: link when
> +in mainline and generated alongside the rest of the documentation):
> +
> +	http://kernel.org/
> +
> +The docs can also be easily generated and read locally. This is quite fast
> +(same order as compiling the code itself) and no special tools or environment
> +are needed. This has the added advantage that they will be tailored to
> +the particular kernel configuration used. To generate them, use the ``rustdoc``
> +target with the same invocation used for compilation, e.g.::
> +
> +	make LLVM=1 rustdoc
> +
> +To read the docs locally in your web browser, run e.g.::
> +
> +	xdg-open rust/doc/kernel/index.html
> +
> +To learn about how to write the documentation, please see the coding guidelines
> +at :ref:`Documentation/rust/coding-guidelines.rst <rust_coding_guidelines>`.
   at Documentation/rust/coding-guidelines.rst.

> +
> +
> +Extra lints
> +-----------
> +
> +While ``rustc`` is a very helpful compiler, some extra lints and analyses are
> +available via ``clippy``, a Rust linter. To enable it, pass ``CLIPPY=1`` to
> +the same invocation used for compilation, e.g.::
> +
> +	make LLVM=1 CLIPPY=1
> +
> +Please note that Clippy may change code generation, thus it should not be
> +enabled while building a production kernel.
> +
> +
> +Abstractions vs. bindings
> +-------------------------
> +
> +Abstractions are Rust code wrapping kernel functionality from the C side.
> +
> +In order to use functions and types from the C side, bindings are created.
> +Bindings are the declarations for Rust of those functions and types from
> +the C side.
> +
> +For instance, one may write a ``Mutex`` abstraction in Rust which wraps
> +a ``struct mutex`` from the C side and calls its functions through the bindings.
> +
> +Abstractions are not available for all the kernel internal APIs and concepts,
> +but it is intended that coverage is expanded as time goes on. "Leaf" modules
> +(e.g. drivers) should not use the C bindings directly. Instead, subsystems
> +should provide as-safe-as-possible abstractions as needed.
> +
> +
> +Conditional compilation
> +-----------------------
> +
> +Rust code has access to conditional compilation based on the kernel
> +configuration:
> +
> +.. code-block:: rust
> +
> +	#[cfg(CONFIG_X)]       // Enabled               (`y` or `m`)
> +	#[cfg(CONFIG_X="y")]   // Enabled as a built-in (`y`)
> +	#[cfg(CONFIG_X="m")]   // Enabled as a module   (`m`)
> +	#[cfg(not(CONFIG_X))]  // Disabled

How about adding a suitable license identifier in a comment?

> +
> +rustc
> +*****
> +
> +A particular version of the Rust compiler is required. Newer versions may or
> +may not work because, for the moment, the kernel depends on some unstable
> +Rust features.
> +
> +If ``rustup`` is being used, enter the checked out source code directory
> +and run::
> +
> +	rustup override set $(scripts/min-tool-version.sh rustc)
> +
> +Otherwise, fetch a standalone installer or install ``rustup`` from:
> +
> +	https://www.rust-lang.org
> +
> +
> +Rust standard library source
> +****************************
> +
> +The Rust standard library source is required because the build system will
> +cross-compile ``core`` and ``alloc``.
> +
> +If ``rustup`` is being used, run::
> +
> +	rustup component add rust-src
> +
> +The components are installed per toolchain, thus upgrading the Rust compiler
> +version later on requires re-adding the component.
> +
> +Otherwise, if a standalone installer is used, the Rust repository may be cloned
> +into the installation folder of the toolchain::
> +
> +	git clone --recurse-submodules \
> +		--branch $(scripts/min-tool-version.sh rustc) \
> +		https://github.com/rust-lang/rust \
> +		$(rustc --print sysroot)/lib/rustlib/src/rust
> +
> +In this case, upgrading the Rust compiler version later on requires manually
> +updating this clone.
> +
> +
> +libclang
> +********
> +
> +``libclang`` (part of LLVM) is used by ``bindgen`` to understand the C code
> +in the kernel, which means LLVM needs to be installed; like when the kernel
> +is compiled with ``CC=clang`` or ``LLVM=1``.
> +
> +Linux distributions are likely to have a suitable one available, so it is
> +best to check that first.
> +
> +There are also some binaries for several systems and architectures uploaded at:
> +
> +	https://releases.llvm.org/download.html
> +
> +Otherwise, building LLVM takes quite a while, but it is not a complex process:
> +
> +	https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html#getting-the-source-code-and-building-llvm
> +
> +See :ref:`Documentation/kbuild/llvm.rst <kbuild_llvm>` for more information and
   See Documentation/kbuild/llvm.rst for more information and

> +further ways to fetch pre-built releases and distribution packages.
> +
> +
> +bindgen
> +*******
> +
> +The bindings to the C side of the kernel are generated at build time using
> +the ``bindgen`` tool. A particular version is required.
> +
> +Install it via (note that this will download and build the tool from source)::
> +
> +	cargo install --locked --version $(scripts/min-tool-version.sh bindgen) bindgen
> +
> +
> +Requirements: Developing
> +------------------------
> +
> +This section explains how to fetch the tools needed for developing. That is,
> +they are not needed when just building the kernel.
> +
> +
> +rustfmt
> +*******
> +
> +The ``rustfmt`` tool is used to automatically format all the Rust kernel code,
> +including the generated C bindings (for details, please see
> +:ref:`Documentation/rust/coding-guidelines.rst <rust_coding_guidelines>`).

> +can be installed manually::
> +
> +	rustup component add rustfmt
> +
> +The standalone installers also come with ``rustfmt``.
> +
> +
> +clippy
> +******
> +
> +``clippy`` is a Rust linter. Running it provides extra warnings for Rust code.
> +It can be run by passing ``CLIPPY=1`` to ``make`` (for details, please see

> +*****

> +``cargo`` is the Rust native build system. It is currently required to run
> +the tests since it is used to build a custom standard library that contains
> +the facilities provided by the custom ``alloc`` in the kernel. The tests can

> +rust-analyzer
> +*************
> +
> +The `rust-analyzer <https://rust-analyzer.github.io/>`_ language server can
> +be used with many editors to enable syntax highlighting, completion, go to
> +definition, and other features.
> +
> +``rust-analyzer`` needs a configuration file, ``rust-project.json``, which
> +can be generated by the ``rust-analyzer`` Make target.
> +
> +
> +Configuration
> +-------------
> +
> +``Rust support`` (``CONFIG_RUST``) needs to be enabled in the ``General setup``
> +menu. The option is only shown if a suitable Rust toolchain is found (see
> +above). In turn, this will make visible the rest of options that depend on Rust.
> +
> +Afterwards, go to::
> +
> +	Kernel hacking
> +	    -> Sample kernel code
> +	        -> Rust samples
> +
> +And enable some sample modules either as built-in or as loadable.
> +
> +
> +Building
> +--------
> +
> +Building a kernel with a complete LLVM toolchain is the best supported setup
> +at the moment. That is::
> +
> +	make LLVM=1
> +
> +For architectures that do not support a full LLVM toolchain, use::
> +
> +	make CC=clang
> +
> +Using GCC also works for some configurations, but it is very experimental at
> +the moment.
> +
> +
> +Hacking
> +-------
> +
> +To dive deeper, take a look at the source code of the samples
> +at ``samples/rust/``, the Rust support code under ``rust/`` and
> +the ``Rust hacking`` menu under ``Kernel hacking``.
> +
> +If GDB/Binutils is used and Rust symbols are not getting demangled, the reason
> +is the toolchain does not support Rust's new v0 mangling scheme yet.
> +There are a few ways out:
> +
> +  - Install a newer release (GDB >= 10.2, Binutils >= 2.36).
> +
> +  - Some versions of GDB (e.g. vanilla GDB 10.1) are able to use
> +    the pre-demangled names embedded in the debug info (``CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO``).

Notes:

Those cross-references of plain path such as

   Documentation/rust/general-information.rst

are recognized when you build by the top level "make htmldocs".
If you specify a subdirectory by "make SPHINXDIRS=rust htmldocs",
current build script can't recognize them.  This is one of (not
widely recognized) issues in subdirectory handling of automarkup.py.
Hopefully, they can be resolved soon.

Tags at the top of .rst files are redundant and should be avoided.
Existing ones can be removed after referencing sites are updated.

        Thanks, Akira
