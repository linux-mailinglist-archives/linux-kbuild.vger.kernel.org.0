This is pretty much the whole reason for this module. Surface devices
vary from generation to generation, and I can't expect some random user
to write some kernel module (or repeatedly pull 10 different versions
of it)to test if some EC command does x or y. I can tell them to run a
script with some arguments though. The main reason for this is
development, debugging is secondary and IMHO part of development.

So, IOW this interface provides direct access to the EC that would,
without it, require you to write a kernel driver.

The whole "this is intended for development and debugging" shtick is to
deter people from using it to implement user-space based drivers. While
this may be possible at some point, at the moment there is no good way
to (reliably) detect which client devices are present from user-space.
So any attempts at that will likely be unstable and should be
implemented in the kernel anyway. It is a way of prototyping drivers
though.

Sure. There's a bunch of scripts at

   https://github.com/linux-surface/surface-aggregator-module/tree/master/scripts/ssam

As described above, the main idea behind this simplifying development
for devices that I can't test myself. See e.g. the "ctrl.py" script
which can be used to send a basic command to the EC. The "hid.py" script
is one that was successfully used to test commands for the Keyboard
driver on the Surface Laptop 1 and 2.

At some point my plan is to maybe split that out into its own repo and
improve usability for all that, but I haven't gotten to that yet.
