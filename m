No need to apologize! Feel free to use the latest threads or a new
thread in e.g. the rust-for-linux ML.

Indeed, but there are workarounds, for instance, we could have a bot
checking -next.

Or we could put it in an opt-in compilation mode (i.e. not for users)
where extra things are checked (like `W=`) that maintainers use so
that e.g. `allmodconfig` builds are kept clean.

Note that the point of using `rustfmt` is that one does not need to
care about the details -- one can e.g. run the tool on file save. So
no need to remember how to do it when writing Rust.

Now, it is true that the Rust syntax resembles C in many cases, so
things like the curly braces for function definitions are similar
enough that we could do the same thing in both sides.

However, most Rust code uses `rustfmt` and typically also follow most
of its defaults, including the standard library, books, etc.; which
helps when reading and reusing other code. This is different from C
and C++, where as you know there is no single style (at least as
prevalent as `rustfmt`), thus one needs to become accustomed to each
project's C style (or ideally use `clang-format` to avoid having to
learn it). So while this is not relevant for C, in the case of Rust,
there is value in using the `rustfmt` style.

As for consistency, one could argue that by using `rustfmt` we are
being consistent with the rest of the Rust code out there. This may be
important for those that have expressed interest on sharing some code
between kernel and userspace; as well as if we end up vendoring some
external crates (similar to what we do with `alloc` now).

As noted in the RFC, we are happy to tweak the style to whatever
kernel developers prefer. We think the particular style is not that
important. Absent other reasons, the defaults seem OK, so we chose
that for simplicity and consistency with as most existing Rust code as
possible.

As for accessibility, I am no expert, so that may be a good point,
especially if editors cannot solve this on their end (so that everyone
could program in all languages/projects regardless of style).

No nerves were damaged :) Thanks for all the input!

Everything is possible, e.g. we could have Rust proc macros that parse
C and things like that. But if we ended up with such a thing, the
solution would be to format each accordingly to its style (indentation
could be an exception, I guess).

Cheers,
Miguel
