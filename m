Simply I wrongly understood your description.

If you manage to correctly configure for the target distro
when building SRPM, that's fine.

In my system (Ubuntu), I see the directory paths

/usr/aarch64-linux-gnu/lib/
/usr/i686-linux-gnu/lib/
/usr/x86_64-linux-gnu/lib/

If there were such a crazy distro that supports multiple kernel arches
within a single image, modules might be installed:
/usr/x86_64-linux-gnu/lib/module/<version>/

I have never seen a distro with /usr/lib-<triplet> hierarchy.

But, I have no idea, since this discussion is hypothetical after all.

"pkg-config --variable=3D<name>" returns its value.
It is pretty simple, and I do not think it is a big problem.

Your code is long, but the reason is that you implemented
it in that way.


If you go with KERNEL_MODULE_DIRECTORY for max flexibility,

  KERNEL_MODULE_DIRECTORY :=3D $(or $(shell pkg-config
--variable=3Dmodule_directory kmod 2>/dev/null),/lib/modules)

should work with less characters and less process forks.

But, now I started to prefer confining the long code
into the shell script, "scripts/modinst-dir",
and calling it where needed.
