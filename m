As far as I am aware the typical use case is two step:

1. run make rpm-pkg on machine A
2. install the binary rpm on machine C that might not have build tools
   or powerful enough CPU

While it's theoretically possible to use the srpm to rebuild the binary
rpm independently of the kernel git tree I am not aware of people
commonly doing this.

If rebuilding the source rpm on a different machine from where the git
tree is located, and possibly on a different distribution is desirable
then the detection of the KERNEL_MODULE_DIRECTORY should be added in the
rpm spec file as well.

I don't. I don't think there will be a separate machine B.

And I can't really either - so far any attempt at adding support for
this has been rejected.

Technically the KERNEL_MODULE_DIRECTORY could be set in two steps - one
giving the script to run, and one running it, and then it could be run
independently in the SRPM as well.

Thanks
