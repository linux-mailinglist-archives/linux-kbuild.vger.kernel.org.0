If it's not a patch to be reviewed, then I'm not going to see it most
likely. I don't read the DT list regularly...

I'm not really interested in diverging from dtc. I'd suggest moving
the discussion to dtc list and/or devicetree-spec if you want to get
more attention on this.

Also, keep in mind that extensions also affect MIME types which
someone was also asking about recently.
