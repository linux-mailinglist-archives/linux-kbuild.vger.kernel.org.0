This patch is doing a lot, it might make sense to split it up. Reviewing
documentation changes is not the easiest as it is.

Comments inline, thanks for the patch!

make ARCH=arm64 LLVM=1

is used throughout the rest of the document and I think it is more
consistent to keep all the variables on the right side of make.

Compare:

$ rg "make .*=" Documentation

vs.

$ rg "=.* make" Documentation

I think

``CC=`` should be set when generating a config and building a kernel.

might read a little bit better?

Are we ready for this yet?

https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/linux/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22%5BARCH%5D+powerpc%22+label%3A%22%5BTOOL%5D+integrated-as%22

I think we could potentially say LLVM=1 LLVM_IAS=0 but pseries_defconfig
does not build with ld.lld:

https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/linux/issues/602

Maybe it is worth breaking up powerpc into powerpc32, powerpc64, and
powerpc64le?

I don't think s390 is ready for this claim. ld.lld and llvm-objcopy do
not support s390, which are both used in a defconfig build, as far as I
am aware.

The rest of the changes look good to me.
