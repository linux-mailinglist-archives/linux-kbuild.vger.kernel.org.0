Can you say that again?

Is this a summary of what you said above and I could not understand?

OK so you're saying sometimes "best" is not true when we use
INSTALL_MOD_STRIP="--strip-unneeded"? This is news.

In particulr you seem to be suggesting that if --strip-unneeded was
used "best" could be incorrect for !is_module_text_address().

In any case, you completely changed things in your patch and did not
mention *any* of this in your follow up patch, leaving me to question
the validity of all this work.

I tried to reproduce and couldn't and sent you a configuration to test.

The above is not clear and you need to make things crystal clear. If the
existing heuristic for best is not valid all the times it needs to be
made clear using a comment, sure.

If your heuristic is *better* than the existing heuristic *today*, that
needs to *also* be clearly spelled out. Your patch does none of this and
the commit log clearly does not reflect it.
