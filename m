OK. I can see from the dmesg snippets you sent that the drives on the ATA ports
seem OK. A quick search tells me that the ST373207LW drive is a Ultra320 SCSI
drive, not ATA. So that MAINTENANCE_IN command issued by scsi_report_opcode()
will straight as-is.

This command has been issued to devices since a long time ago, and given that
your system was working, the drive is probably fine with it in its simplest form
(one command format). CDL changes however added probing command support with the
service action field (One command format with service action). And what may be
happening is that the drive does not like/does not support that format and
chokes on it.

Let me check the specs to see what scsi level support this format. What is sure
is that Ultra320 SCSI disks will definitely *not* support CDL, so we could exit
early in scsi_cdl_check_cmd() returning false for drives with an old scsi level
support.

Let me send something along these lines.
