It requires an absolute path. This is to align with other variables
using the config_filename macro: CONFIG_SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS,
CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_KEY and now CONFIG_SYSTEM_REVOCATION_KEYS.
Cf. https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1221725.1607515111@warthog.procyon.org.uk/

We may want to patch scripts/kconfig/streamline_config.pl for both
CONFIG_SYSTEM_REVOCATION_KEYS and CONFIG_SYSTEM_BLACKLIST_HASH_LIST, to
warn user (and exit with an error) if such files are not found.
