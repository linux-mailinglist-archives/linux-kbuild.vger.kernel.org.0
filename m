Thanks for CC'ing me on the printk ringbuffer thread. It looks like it
actually probably won't affect my needs for KUnit logging. The biggest
reason I need some sort of buffering system is to be able to compose
messages piece meal into a single message that will be printed out to
the user as a single message with no messages from other printk
callers printed out in the middle of mine.

The prb does look interesting; however, it appears that to get the
semantics that I need, I would have to put my entire message in a
single data block and would consequently need to know the size of my
message a priori, which is problematic. Consequently, it seems as
though I will probably need to compose my entire message using my own
buffering system.

Yeah, we discussed it briefly here:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/5/17/497

Looks like I forgot to include my reasoning in the commit text, sorry
about that.

Yeah, well printk will not be our only problem in those instances.

No worries, I don't expect printk to be the hang up in those cases. It
sounds like KUnit has a long way to evolve before printk is going to
be a limitation.

Thanks!
