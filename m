Ah, I missed the examples, I thought that was a test for the feature :)

Yes, it needs to be documented somewhere, and usually documentation is
in Documentation/ so that it shows up on the web and everywhere else.

I can't think of it, but perhaps we need a check somewhere to ensure
that these symbol names do NOT end up in the main kernel tree?

Or just keep this whole patch as an add-on on the end that is only
applied by the distro kernels and is not merged into mainline at all?

The Android macros are a copy of what SLES and RHEL does so that's good.

And yes, an example macro would be nice so we all don't have to reinvent
it yet-again like we have done already.  Consolidation is nice.

That feels ripe for problems for any rust code as forcing a helper macro
for a "normal" access to a structure field is going to be a lot of churn
over time.  Is the need for a macro due to the fact that accessing a
union is always considered "unsafe" in rust?  If that's the case, ick,
this is going to get even messier even faster as the need for sprinkling
unsafe accesses everywhere for what used to be a normal/safe one will
cause people to get nervous...
