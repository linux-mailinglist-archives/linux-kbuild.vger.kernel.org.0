I was mostly arguing about a) lets look at this and b) having said 
configuration tweaks, rather then blindly (pun not really intended) 
going with rust's defaults :)

So kernel style kind of says 'no braces around single statements'; but 
if your rust compiler doesn't allow this; well then there's nothing to 
do. You could even argue to update the kernel C style on this to make it 
consistent again. BUT, this inconsistency makes it cognative 'hard'. If 
this if a C or a rust function? for example during a review. During 
authoring, when writing both C and rust code (due to nececity, not 
constant context switching) you cognitivly constantly have to go 
back/foward. While I'm sure there's people here that can do this all day 
without problem, some of of find this harder then needs to be. Hence the 
request to _try_ to keep consistency within the kernel tree.

Sure, this rule implies that for alignment, tabs should be set to 8 so 
things align nicely. However, nobody forces people to set their editor 
to 8 character width. Not doing so, doesn't break anything. At worst, 
you may commit something that is poorly aligned (but we _should_ be 
using tabs to indent, spaces to align anyway :p, tab == indent has meaning).

With non-tab indentation, this is no longer really possible, or at 
least, editors haven't solved that problem yet, as it tends to still 
break (due to the mixing of indentation and alignment using a single 
character). Maybe once we have AI and ML in our editors though :p

Very fair point of course. Though really, we should fix the upstream 
rust preferred format, but there it was already stated, that 'too bad, 
sorry' which from a developer point of view is fine, your project, your 
choice. From a disabilities point of view, sucks of course.

And I'm happy for you that you can easily take in 2 and 4 spaces. For 
me, it is extremly hard to read. So it's not a 'personal preference' 
thing. But I suggest to read the earlier posted links, where others at 
length explain it as well, how it is like to feel excluded becaues its 
just hard to read.

I'm not even arguing this at all :)

I think the biggest issues i'm speaking of really are the braces and the 
spaces really, where the braces can be argued for/against, it's 
cognitive harder, but can be dealth with (and we can expect 
inconsitencies; but the sapces vs tabs thing, personal configuration vs 
forced with is the point I was trying to raise.

As said before, 'every building is different, some offer wheelchair 
ramps, others do' kind of point, not like 'this building is red, and 
that one is blue, and not every color fits all :p
