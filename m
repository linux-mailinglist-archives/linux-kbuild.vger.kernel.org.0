STG is an interesting tool. I've played with it a bit last year. To be
frank, I was surprised to see a new tool being proposed by Google to
generate modversion CRCs from DWARF instead of potentially extending
your STG project for this purpose. I'm not sure if it is something that
you folks have considered and evaluated.

Sure, it might be necessary to extend the symtypes format a bit, for
example, by allowing spaces in type names. What other problems do you
see?

The example I showed preserves the DWARF tag names in type descriptions.
Cross-references and the target type names use the s# prefix as they
they need to be distinguished from other tokens.

What I think is needed is the ability to compare an updated kernel with
some previous reference and have an output that clearly and accurately
shows why CRCs of some symbols changed. The previous reference should be
possible to store in Git together with the kernel source. It means it
should be ideally some text format and limited in size. This is what
distributions that care about stable kABI do in some form currently.

This functionality would be needed if some distribution wants to
maintain stable Rust kABI (not sure if it is actually feasible), or if
the idea is for gendwarfksyms to be a general tool that could replace
genksyms. I assume for the sake of argument that this is the case.

Gendwarfksyms could implement this functionality on its own, or as
discussed, I believe it could provide a symtypes-like dump and a second
tool could be used to work with this format and for comparing it.

From my point of view, the current --debug format is not suitable for
this purpose because its expanded and unstructured form means it is
bloated and hard to compare with a previous reference.

I'm also not quite yet sold on using separate DWARF tooling, such as
libabigail or STG, to actually understand why gendwarfksyms produced
a different CRC for some symbol. Using these tools makes sense in the
genksyms world, where genksyms operates on the source code level and
this additional tooling can only work on debug data.

With gendwarfksyms working directly with DWARF data, it doesn't seem
appealing to me to first run gendwarfksyms to produce CRCs, compare them
with their reference, and if they are different, use a second tool to
process the same DWARF data again and with some luck hopefully get an
actual answer why the CRCs changed. I'm worried that users might
encounter inaccurate answers if the two tools interpret the input data
differently.
