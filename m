Hi Petr,

Looking at this code, I would agree that it looks very suspicious with
respect to leaking memory.  Then I remembered that I had been testing
with valgrind and it hadn't reported any lost allocations.

I was confused, so to verify, I fired up gdb with conditional
breakpoints (when the passed pointer was one of the clobbered X-Y->d_buf
pointers) on glibc's __GI___libc_free() and found that these buffers
were all handled by libelf's elf_end() function:

	/* The section data is allocated if we couldn't mmap
	   the file.  */
	if (elf->map_address == NULL)
	  free (scn->rawdata_base);

The program, in the name of efficiency or developer expediency (I dunno,
I didn't create it), ends up creating a few file representations:

  1) libelf's internal representation of the input ELF file
  2) klp-convert's structures (see elf.h)
       a) derived from the previous (1)
       b) modified for klp-relocations
  3) klp-convert's new Elf structure for the output ELF file (see
     write_file())
       a) information from (2b) is used to create consistent structures

And so representation (2) ends up with some data values (enums, etc.)
from (1) which is OK.  In a few places, however, it copies the buffer
pointers from (1)... and then as you noticed, may need to realloc them
for step (2b).  Now buffer ownership is muddled and depends on the
runtime situation.

Do you think it would be worth some refactoring to try and keep library
and program allocated memory separate?  In cases where klp-convert only
needs to read memory, perhaps a naming or scoping convention could help.
For those re-allocations, I can't think of anything clever aside from
separate buffers or noting original (ie, library) pointer values.

Yes, that's a good recommendation.  I think this would improve the error
handling and isn't too hard to implement.

The assumption in the code seems to be that elf_write_file() and the
update_*() functions it calls would only ever be done once.

And then, I think, that the new output file Elf structure created by
write_file() and passed to elf_update(), would have consistent offset
and indexes since the klp-converted structures are iterated in order as
appropriate gelf_update_*() are called.

If something else looks amiss, please point it out and I can try to
verify using my tests.

If you have specifics in mind, I can verify empirically and research
if/how libelf abstracts this for us or not (endianness in cross-arch
scenarios, for example).

Interesting, I didn't know about readelf --enable-checks / --lint.  Do
you know if this is any different from elflint?

In any case, I can take a look at those, but as you noticed, it looks
like all of the complaints also crop up outside of klp-convert cases.  I
wonder if kernel linker script is unconditionally creating those
zero-sized sections?
