Now imagine, you are building a kernel that has no DT support for the Veyron,
but instead has support for the Phytec RK3288 PCM-947:

  phytec,rk3288-pcm-947", "phytec,rk3288-phycore-som", "rockchip,rk3288

As far as I understand U-Boot code, A veyron U-Boot would boot the Phytec DT
if CONFIG_FIT_BEST_MATCH is set, although it's a bad match and a boot failure
should rather have occurred.

Thanks Doug, this was helpful. The missing information to me was that
depthcharge only compares the top-level board compatible in addition
to runtime generated board compatibles, unlike what U-Boot seems to do.

barebox only compares its top-level compatible against the FIT configuration
compatibles, so adding a full compatible list to the configuration nodes as done
by this series should be ok there as well. I think U-Boot could run into
issues though as described above.

Out of curiosity: I only heard about Depthcharge before as exploitation toolkit
for U-Boot. Can you point me at some documentation on what the Depthcharge bootloader
does what U-Boot (which was presumably used before?) doesn't?

Thanks,
Ahmad
