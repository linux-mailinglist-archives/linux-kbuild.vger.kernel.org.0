From the livepatching POV:

  + It needs a way to distinguish duplicate symbols within a module.

  + It does _not_ need to distinguish symbols which have the same name
    in two modules or in a module and vmlinux.

Background: The livepatch contains a structure where the livepatched
symbols are already split per-livepatched objects: vmlinux or modules.
I has to know whether a later loaded or removed module is livepatched
or not and what functions need some tweaking.

From my POV:

The source path and the line number is enough to distinguish duplicate
symbols even in modules.

The added module name would just add extra complexity into the kernel
and tools parsing and using the alias. The tracing tools would need to
handle the source path and line number anyway for symbols duplicated
within same module/vmlinux.

Adding module name for builtin modules might be misleading. It won't
be clear which symbols are in vmlinux binary and which are in
real modules.
