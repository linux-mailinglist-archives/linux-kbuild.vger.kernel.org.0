Right, I will add that to the commit message. I just linked you the
scripts in my other response, but here again for completeness:

   https://github.com/linux-surface/surface-aggregator-module/tree/master/scripts/ssam

While I'm not using the header directly (the scripts are written in
python) I still think uapi is the right place to put this (please
correct me if I'm wrong). Not putting them there seems to be needless
obfuscating to me.

Max
