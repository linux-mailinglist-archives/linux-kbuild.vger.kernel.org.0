I opened that issue purely based on noticing the wart in the Makefile,
not because I'd actually tested it.

Haha, written by me, what an idiot.

So the Makefile hack can presumably be dropped, because the module
loader can handle the relocations.

And then maybe we also want to turn off the unwind tables, but that
would be a separate patch.

No, as I said above it was just reading the Makefile.

cheers
