OK, I'll add those to their respective lists.

I don't think that this use-case has been previously thought out 
(Miroslav, correct me if I'm wrong here.)

I did just run an external build of a copy of 
samples/livepatch/livepatch-annotated-sample.c:

  - modules.livepatch is generated in external dir
  - klp-convert is invoked for the livepatch module
  - the external livepatch module successfully loads

But that was only testing external livepatch modules.

I don't know if we need/want to support general external modules 
supplementing Symbols.list, at least for the initial klp-convert commit. 
  I suppose external livepatch modules would then need to specify 
additional Symbols.list(s) files somehow as well.

I don't know if the "Symbols.list" name and leading uppercase was based 
on any convention, but something like symbols.klp would be fine with me.

Thanks,
