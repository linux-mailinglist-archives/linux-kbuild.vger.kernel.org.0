Is this commit log OK?

The 32-bit ARM kernel stops working if the kernel grows to the point
where veneers for __get_user_* are created.

AAPCS32 [1] states, "Register r12 (IP) may be used by a linker as a
scratch register between a routine and any subroutine it calls. It
can also be used within a routine to hold intermediate values between
subroutine calls."

However, the bl instruction buried within the inline asm is unpredictable
for compilers; hence, "ip" must be added to the clobber list.

This becomes critical when veneers for __get_user_* are created because
veneers use the ip register since commit 02e541db0540 ("ARM: 8323/1:
force linker to use PIC veneers").
