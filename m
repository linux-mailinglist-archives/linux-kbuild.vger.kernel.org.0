Do you have a working example?
Since the config is sourced in the scripts/setlocalversion it will
not work correctly anyway.

Escaping is not so easy since the very same content is included
in shell scripts (sertlocalversion), in Makefiles and in C files.
At least I didn't find find a good way to escape these characters
such that all three programming environments will accept it.
