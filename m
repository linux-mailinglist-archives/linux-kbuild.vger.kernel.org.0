Well actually, now I see this comment in the top-level Makefile:

# Cleaning is done on three levels. 

# make clean     Delete most generated files 

#                Leave enough to build external modules 

# make mrproper  Delete the current configuration, and all generated 
files
# make distclean Remove editor backup files, patch leftover files and 
the like

I didn't realize that we're supposed to be able to still build external 
modules after "make clean".  If that's the case, then one might want to 
build an external klp-module after doing that.

With that in mind, shouldn't Symbols.list to persist until mrproper? 
And I think modules-livepatch could go away during clean, what do you think?
