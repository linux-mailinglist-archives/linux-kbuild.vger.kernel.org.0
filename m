Yes. This is rather coding policy of <linux/kconfig.h>

If you want to use IF_ENABLED(), you  must understand that
it is internally using NULL and include <linux/stddef.h>.

It is the reason why we should make headers self-contained.

<linux/kernel.h> is too widely used, so some other headers
would have already included it eventually.
But, correct, it is better to include it explicitly for completeness.

The function is optimized out by the compiler, not by the pre-processor.
So, -Wunused-but-set-variable does not complain about it.

I understand, but this is a one-time fix.

<linux/kconfig.h> is not changed so often.

I believe this will be useful for SET_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM_OPS cleanups.
So, the macro must be placed in a public header.

Yes or no. I am not sure about the future of this.

I prefer this in a more general expression,
so IS_REACHABLE or the combination of two CONFIG options
will work.

  PTR_IF(IS_REACHABLE(CONFIG_FOO),  ...)

  PTR_IF( IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_FOO) && IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_BAR), ...)

Rather, I was considering sending a pull req before -rc1.

Otherwise, other drivers may start to use it.
