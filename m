Thank you for this explanation, that is going to be useful to know
when I get around to reviewing this set (although I guess that you
probably also have written this down in one of the commit msgs /
docs I did not check).

I agree, the whole setup with the TC + TID + IID feels like the functionality
is nicely (and cleanly) split into separate functions and as with other
busses using a bus + 1 device per function for this is a perfectly clean
way to handle this.

Note if in the future you do see benefit in switching the auxiliary bus
I have no problems with that. But atm I don't really see any benefits of
doing so, so then we would just be switching over for the sake of switching
over which does not seem productive.

Hans
