I want to thank you for this observation because it gives me the chance to
discuss this topic.

It is evident that the corner case in question is inherently challenging
to address using the addr2line approach. Attempting to conceal this
limitation would be counterproductive.

compat_binfmt_elf.c includes directly binfmt_elf.c, addr2line can't help
but report all functions and data declared in that file, coming from that
file. compat_binfmt_elf.c is just a bunch of macro definitions that
rename a few symbols and define some items used in macro-defined
compilation in binfmt_elf.c.

Looking at the functions, only two of the functions defined by
compat_binfmt_elf.c are binary different from their counterpart in
binfmt_elf.c.
These differences, while present, are indeed minimal, but this fact not
relevant to this discussion.

My position is that, rather than producing a more complicated pipeline
to handle this corner case, it is better to fix it. Before reading your
message, I was about to send the v4, but now I'd prefer to hear the
others' opinions on this matter before taking any future action.

Regarding the use of full file paths and line numbers for symbol decoration,
it indeed provides the highest level of uniqueness for each symbol.
However, I understand your point that this level of detail might be more than
necessary.

This approach was implemented in response to a specific request expressed in
the live-patching list, and I wanted to ensure we met those requirements.
I am open to revisiting this aspect, and I am willing to accommodate changes
based on feedback.

If you believe that simplifying the format to just path + name would be more
practical, or if you think that eliminating line numbers is a better choice
to avoid potential issues while debugging builds, I'm open to considering
these adjustments.
Additionally, I've interpreted and implemented Francis's suggestion as making
the separator a configurable option, but maybe a proper format string here,
would be more appropriate.
