 Well, maybe that was a conscious decision, however it's a linker feature 
that has been there since forever and projects like Linux can legitimately 
rely on it.  In this case perhaps sticking to other linkers, which have 
the right features, is the right solution rather than trying to turn a 
complex and mature project like Linux upside down (and quite possibly 
introducing bugs and pessimisations on the way) just to match an inferior 
tool.  Adapt your tool to the task, not the task to your tool.

 It's a standard feature of libraries that a symbol reference is satisfied 
by the first symbol definition encountered.  Any extra ones provided later 
in the link order are ignored.  And we have control over the link order.

 Naturally, many platforms will have its own, in addition to some generic 
(possibly dummy) one.

 Hmm, what intention?  Can you please be more specific?
