Thanks for pushing me too ;)

Oh, I was shared one schematics internally and told that it was the mirror of
the T14s and it had the M.2 slot. So I just went with that. I didn't dare to
open the cover of my corporate laptop ;)

But this is a good info, thanks!

But the spec uses 1620 BGA for defining the SSD pinout. So 1620 LGA indeed looks
like a custom one.

I think having a separate compatible that uses the same binding should be
sufficient since the interfaces are almost the same.
