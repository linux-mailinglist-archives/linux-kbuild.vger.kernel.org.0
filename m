It would be cleaner, rather than the "depends" line getting longer
and longer over time - and if different architecture maintainers
change it, it will lead to conflicts.

Right, so why made it dependent on CPU_32v6 || CPU_32v6K if ARMv7 is
supported? What about CPU_32v7? What about CPU_32v7M?

I think it would be saner to use the CPU_V6, CPU_V6K, CPU_V7 and maybe
CPU_V7M here - even bettern to select "HAVE_RUST" from these symbols,
since I'm sure you'd start to see the issue behind my "HAVE_RUST"
suggestion as it means having four symbols just for 32-bit ARM on your
dependency line.

Interestingly, it does not list arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf, which
is the "tuple" commonly used to build 32-bit ARM kernels.

Probably because people incorrectly think it's required or some other
minor reason. As I say:

config FOO
	bool/tristate ...

always defaults to 'n' without needing "default n" to be specified.

Let's do some proper research on this. There are 19148 "config"
statements in the kernel tree, 521 "default n" and 4818 that
specify any kind of "default". That means there are about 14330
config statements that do not specify any kind of default.

So, there are about 27 times more config statements that specify no
default than those that specify "default n", so using the argument
that there are "500+ instances" and therefore should be seen as
correct is completely misguided.

I mean, if we end up with, e.g. a filesystem coded in Rust, that
filesystem will not be available on architectures that the kernel
supports until either (a) Rust gains support for that architecture
or (b) someone re-codes the filesystem in C - at which point, what
is the point of having Rust in the kernel?
