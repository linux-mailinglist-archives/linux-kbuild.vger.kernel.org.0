I don't think it requires two flags.  do_pci_entry() has:

  if (flags & PCI_ID_F_VFIO_DRIVER_OVERRIDE)
    strcpy(alias, "vfio_pci:");

I'm just proposing a rename:

s/PCI_ID_F_VFIO_DRIVER_OVERRIDE/PCI_ID_DRIVER_OVERRIDE/

Hahaha, I see, that's fair :)  It confused me for a long time why you
wanted "VFIO" in the flag name because from the kernel's point of
view, the flag is not related to any VFIO-ness.  It's only related to
a special variety of driver_override, and VFIO happens to be one user
of it.

I think a separate patch that maps the flag to "vfio_pci" would be
less confusing because without the distractions of the PCI core
changes, it will be obvious that "vfio_" is a file2alias thing that's
there for userspace convenience, not for kernel reasons.

Do you envision any other prefixes in the future?  I hope we don't
have to clutter pci_match_device() with checking multiple flags.
Maybe the problem is that the modules.alias entry includes "vfio_" --
maybe we need a more generic prefix with just the idea of an
"alternate" driver.
