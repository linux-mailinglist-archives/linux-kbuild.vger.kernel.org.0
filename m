Can I get a link to the documentation stating that or someone else
confirming that?

Also I don't think it makes sense to have a platform/surface device in
drivers/misc, after we've explicitly decided to move this code out of
there. IIRC drivers/misc is not a place for misc-devices, but the
directory for devices that don't have any good place elsewhere.

So it's okay to break stuff that's not explicitly in include/uapi/?
Again, can I get someone to confirm that for me?

As already said, I'm okay with moving the definitions from the header to
the module itself (if there is a consensus on that, CC Greg, Hans),
however both allow you to build user-space tools against the API. Case
in point my python scripts, which don't use the header. Or any other
non-C-based tool. So unless there's a rule that anything without a
header in uapi is fair game, I fail to see your point.

This point again depends on the interface not being stable. Unless, of
course, you want me to remove the interface completely and just maintain
it out of tree...

I'm happy to be told otherwise by the authorities here, but from past
conversations it seems that basically everything providing some sort of
user-space access falls under the "don't break user-space" rule as soon
as somebody uses it.

Max
