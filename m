I have not seen this issue without stripping so far as in that case it will find
some better match with some .text address but I have seen this consistently
with stripping.

yes. This is seen with stripping only.

yes. I assume you meant when stripping is not used.

yes. so I tested .init , .text and one data address (without being
stripped) to make
sure there is no affect. Attached the result in my previous mail.

Ok

Sure. Thanks for educating me.
