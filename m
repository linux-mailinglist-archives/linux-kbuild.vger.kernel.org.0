Hi Rob, David,

Patient Geert has pinged again.

If I remember correctly you guys were not thrilled with this idea, but
also did not seem strongly against it.  Are you willing to go along
with .dtso for overlay source files?  If so, I will revive this patch
series.

David, if you are against supporting .dtso in the dtc compiler then
the kernel can still support it through make rules.

-Frank
