Let me sum up: It is possible to build out-of-tree kmods with subdirs
in their source tree.
The patch attempts to put support for _out-of-source builds_ of
out-of-tree kmods with subdirs into kbuild itself.

If you really out-of-source builds for your complex out-of-tree kmods,
than, as a "work-around", you can simply put those 'src' override lines
into your oot-Kbuild files.  But you probably know that already, right?

Daniel,

I am confused about the outcome from your argumentation that you might
expect.  And I think, I as a spare-time reviewer (not maintainer), am
not the one you want to argue with.

If you have a concrete technical issue or bug, please explain it
concretely to linux-kbuild and we will probably find someone trying to
help you.  If you want me to hide critical thoughts when reviewing
patches under your pillow, then please tell me so.

Have a nice weekend,
Nicolas
