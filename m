Hi,

some preliminary tests gave roughly a 5% build time speed-up with -O1.
That is to say that the impact seems quite limited, after all.
This was done on building /drivers/net/ or /drivers/net/ethernet/ only.

I don't have numbers for the impact on memory consumption.

Given the feedbacks on -O1 which is unlikely to be able to build a full 
kernel and your position on yet another option for a very specific use 
case, I won't push the idea further.

I'll keep it in my own tree for (small) build time improvement when 
running smatch.

The idea of turning off a subset of -O2 options would just be some too 
fine tuning. I'll certainly try it for my own use, but it would end to 
an un-understandable list of flags in Makefile.
-O1 (or -O0) was simple. A more complex solution is way too much.


Thanks for your feedbacks.

Thanks for taking time for a full review, even on something you are not 
fan on. This is really appreciated.
