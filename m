I think it is acceptable to state this usage of the build system is
unsupported.  This is not an acceptable reason to reject proposed
patches.

While this use of M= might be considered a hack, adjusting $(srctree) to
include the trailing slash is entirely appropriate.  Everything which
worked before still works and more situations now work.  This also
slightly shrinks the Makefiles.

Notice 306 Makefiles (excluding the top-level) reference $(srctree).  Of
those 26 include the construct which appears to be working around this
problem.  So 8.5% of Makefiles work around this problem, which seems a
pretty good hint the feature is desired.

This doesn't account for Makefiles which had such during development, but
was removed before submission.  This also doesn't account for ones which
had it removed after being brought into the Linux source tree.  The
differences between implementations suggest it might have been
independently implemented as many as 3-4 times.

That seems a good hint this is desired by a notable percentage of
developers.


In other news, examination of tools/testing/selftests/nolibc/Makefile
suggests $(objtree) needs similar treatment.
