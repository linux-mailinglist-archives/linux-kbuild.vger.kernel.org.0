Hi, Masahiro,

Thank you for your reply.

> New release of what?

Forgive me for not being precise. It was the new release of torvalds tree mainline
kernel 6.7+ (with merge commits up-to-date). I sort of mistakenly assumed that
I wrote it, but it was declared in some mail on LKML.

One environment was Ubuntu 23.10 Mantic Minotaur on the desktop at work.

The laptop also has Mantic Minotaur, but for some reason it spawns multithreaded
dpkg-deb when building packages, unlike desktop which spawned single-threaded "xz".

This is at least what the "top" displayed when turning on "H" (show threads).

On one system (upgraded 23.10 from 22.04 LTS) the same dpkg-deb shows as multi-threaded
dpkg-deb, while on the other it calls xz which didn't respect XT_OPT=-T0 (visible
from the copy+paste from top output).

I am perplexed myself.

It should be. Somehow it doesn't behave rationally. To be true to the facts,
one is 23.10 Mantic Minotaur upgraded from 22.04 LTS, and the other is
fresh Mantic from install.

This is correct.

Yes, it is the build from Debian 11 source package.

This had the similar rationale because Ubuntu version ran single-threaded.

dpkg-deb from Debian 11 source package worked well for months.

I see. But the home-built dpkg-deb also resorted to running "xz", and
xz did not recognise XZ_OPT environment variable. Very odd. :-/

Verified. "man dpkg-deb" confirms that.

Somehow, my Mantic's "xz" did not react to the environment variables. Maybe it is
enchanted? :-/

I was seeing exactly what I copy+pasted (top output). Give me the benefit of doubt
that I did not falsify copy+paste. Ideally, I should have submitted JPG terminal
screenshot.

Home-built dpkg-deb worked well on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and 23.10 (upgraded from 22.04).
So it was a surprise that it started showing quirks on this new box with fresh 23.10
from .iso.

But I am only 16 months in the Linux kernel development, so it is probably my fault.

I saw from the output of "ps xewww" that "xz" had "XZ_OPT=-T0", but it refused to obey
the environment variable.

This is probably worth digging and delving into to find the culprit, but eventually the
workaround was the script manually prepending "--threads=0" to the parameter list and
calling system xz:

	/usr/bin/xz --threads=0 "$@"

Certainly, I need to establish "normality" before building complex kernels and applying
patches or the results will be non-reproducible and useless.

I did the background search on your valuable contributions to the LK, but as we have this
problem with the vanilla installation of Ubuntu, maybe we can think of something to
optimise the LK build time?

To recall better from Thursday, I actually tried to prepend "XZ_OPT=--threads=0" to
system xz, and it worked. But when called from dpkg-deb, it suddenly got amnesia, despite
XZ_OPT=-T0 being seen in "ps xewww" output :-/

I believe there should be a rational explanation rather than black or red magic.

Thank you again for considering this problem report and have a nice weekend!

Best regards,
Mirsad Todorovac
