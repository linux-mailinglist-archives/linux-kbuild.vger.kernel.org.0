Masahiro Yamada: thx for taking care of this and Greg for picking the
fix up.

BTW, Bagas, this apparently is a regression that only affected stable.
In that case please tell rezbot about the stable commit-id of the
change, as otherwise it will consider the problem a regression in
mainline (and there it's was never a problem or already solved [didn't
look]).

Let me fix this up and tell regzbot about the incoming fix while at it:

#regzbot introduced: 6061ac50f1e04
#regzbot fix: kbuild: make modules_install copy modules.builtin(.modinfo)

I don't known if Bagas does, but I do not and have no plans to do so.

I consider my work on looking at bugzilla for regressions a courtesy I
perform in the interest of the "no regressions" rule, as some or many of
those report otherwise will be ignored. And that's bad for our reputation.

But that is where my courtesy stops. Those that think having a bugzilla
around should take care of maintaining the state. Bugbot might soon
solve part of the problem. But I guess it won't handle this case.

Ciao, Thorsten
