Then, you cannot explain why KERNEL_MODULE_DIRECTORY should be exposed
as a user interface.



The MODULE_DIRECTORY in depmod is determined when kmod is compiled.

Kbuild takes KERNEL_MODULE_DIRECTORY from pkg-config.


If these two do not agree, it never works.

No, it does not work.


The user has no way to override the MODULE_DIRECTORY in depmod.

That is true when modules are compiled and installed on the local machine.


If you create an SRPM with KERNEL_MODULE_DIRECTORY,
builders must follow it.
