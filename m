Your approach specifies %{MODLIB} as a fixed string
when generating kernel.spec, i.e. at the SRPM time.


 %files
 %defattr (-, root, root)
-/lib/modules/%{KERNELRELEASE}
-%exclude /lib/modules/%{KERNELRELEASE}/build
+%{MODLIB}
+%exclude %{MODLIB}/build
 /boot/*


Then, how to change the path later?






I do not know if the relocatable package
is a sensible solution because the kernel package has /boot/

http://ftp.rpm.org/api/4.4.2.2/relocatable.html


We might be able to tweak installation paths in %post section.

Or perhaps, %{shell } can defer the module path detection
until building RPM.

%define MOD_PREFIX    %{shell pkg-config --variable=3Dmodule_prefix
libkmod 2>/dev/null}


Overall, I did not find a cool solution.

That's good you care about the cost of $(shell ) invocations.

:=3D is evaluated one time at maximum, but one time at minimum.

$(shell ) is always invoked for non-build targets as
"make clean", "make help", etc.
That is what I care about.


?=3D is a recursive variable.

The workaround for one-time evaluation is here,
https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?64746#comment2

However, that is not a problem because I can do it properly somehow,
for example, with "private export".

Sorry, it is not easy for me.

What is the background of your thought?

It IS convoluted.

This is up to the kmod maintainer.

If they agree, I do not mind where the configuration comes from.
