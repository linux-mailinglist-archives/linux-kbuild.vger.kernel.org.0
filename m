hi  Eric :

Do you know why this sha256 check is put here? I feel that it is
better to put it in the system call of kexec -e.
If the verification is not passed, the second kernel will not be
started, and some prompt information will be
printed at the same time, which seems to be better than when the
second kernel is started.
Doing the verification operation will be more friendly, and it can
also reduce downtime.
