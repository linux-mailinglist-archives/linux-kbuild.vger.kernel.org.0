I had a config setting of Linux in mind. :-)

Yes. auto.conf is .config post processed.
This is exactly where my mitigation takes place.

Yes. But the key/values are taken as-is.

Just add some odd characters to your .config, build the kernel and observe
the breakage at different levels.
Or something like CONFIG_DEFAULT_HOSTNAME="`touch owned`". ;-)

My concern is that currently a .config file can contain hostile content
that will get executed at build time.
.config files are often blindly shared across untrusted developers.
So I thought that mitigating this whole is worth it.

I need to think about that. Thanks for the pointer.

Thanks,
