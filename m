Yes. That idea exists, and at least for xconfig,
I got a patch to grey out hidden options.

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-kbuild/20200708133015.12286-1-maxime.chretien=
@bootlin.com/


I liked the idea, and suggested improvements, but did not receive v2.

Maybe I could revisit it when I have some time,
but I always have TODOs more than my capacity.



Anyway, I applied Sergey's patch, so the life of you guys
will get a little easier.
