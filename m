fyi, none of the above is suitable for a [0/N] changelog - it's all
transitory stuff which tells readers nothing much about what the
patchset does.

And that info is sorely missed.  I can see that it's a code cleanup,
but I'm sure Cisco wouldn't expend resources to maintain such a thing. 
There's something else here.

In [1/8] I see "Even with mips and powerpc enhancement the needs of
Cisco are not met on these platforms" and "This unified implementation
offers the same functionality needed by Cisco on all platform which we
enable it on".

Well OK, what are these needs?   What functionality changes does this
patchset offer which Cisco finds useful?  IOW, what were the
requirements?  What's wrong with the old code and how does this
patchset fix/enhance that?


I see the patchset updates nothing under Documentation/.  Should it do
so?  Could it do so?


I don't know what is the expected merge patch for this work.  I can
grab them if no other maintainer is in the firing line.
