+UAPI Checker
+============
+
+The UAPI checker (``scripts/check-uapi.sh``) is a shell script which
+checks UAPI header files for userspace backwards-compatibility across
+the git tree.
+
+Options
+=======
+
+This section will describe the options with which ``check-uapi.sh``
+can be run.
+
+Usage::
+
+    check-uapi.sh [-b BASE_REF] [-p PAST_REF] [-j N] [-l ERROR_LOG] [-i] [-q] [-v]
+
+Available options::
+
+    -b BASE_REF    Base git reference to use for comparison. If unspecified or empty,
+                   will use any dirty changes in tree to UAPI files. If there are no
+                   dirty changes, HEAD will be used.
+    -p PAST_REF    Compare BASE_REF to PAST_REF (e.g. -p v6.1). If unspecified or empty,
+                   will use BASE_REF^1. Must be an ancestor of BASE_REF. Only headers
+                   that exist on PAST_REF will be checked for compatibility.
+    -j JOBS        Number of checks to run in parallel (default: number of CPU cores).
+    -l ERROR_LOG   Write error log to file (default: no error log is generated).
+    -i             Ignore ambiguous changes that may or may not break UAPI compatibility.
+    -q             Quiet operation.
+    -v             Verbose operation (print more information about each header being checked).
+
+Environmental args::
+
+    ABIDIFF  Custom path to abidiff binary
+    CC       C compiler (default is "gcc")
+    ARCH     Target architecture of C compiler (default is host arch)
+
+Exit codes::
+
+    0) Success
+    1) ABI difference detected
+    2) Prerequisite not met
+
+Examples

+
+Basic Usage

+anything. You can pass the ``-i`` flag to the script to ignore changes

+Alternatively, we could have also run with ``-b HEAD~``. This would set the

+Architecture-specific Headers

+
+This is a change to an arm64-specific UAPI header file. In this example, I'm
+running the script from an x86 machine with an x86 compiler, so, by default,
+the script only checks x86-compatible UAPI header files::

+
+With an x86 compiler, we can't check header files in ``arch/arm64``, so the
+script doesn't even try.
+
+If we want to check the header file, we'll have to use an arm64 compiler and

+
+We can see with ``ARCH`` and ``CC`` set properly for the file, the ABI
+change is reported properly. Also notice that the total number of UAPI
+header files checked by the script changes. This is because the number
+of headers installed for arm64 platforms is different than x86.

+    #include <linux/types.h>
+
+Note that the script noticed the failing header file did not change,

+
+Removing a UAPI header is considered a breaking change, and the script
+will flag it as such.
+
+Checking Historic UAPI Compatibility
+------------------------------------
+
+You can use the ``-b`` and ``-p`` options to examine different chunks of your
+git tree. For example, to check all changed UAPI header files between tags
+v6.0 and v6.1, you'd run::
+
+    % ./scripts/check-uapi.sh -b v6.1 -p v6.0
+    Installing user-facing UAPI headers from v6.1... OK
+    Installing user-facing UAPI headers from v6.0... OK
+    Checking changes to UAPI headers between v6.0 and v6.1...
+
+    --- snip ---
+    error - 37/907 UAPI headers compatible with x86 appear _not_ to be backwards compatible
+
+Note: Before v5.3, a header file needed by the script is not present,
+so the script is unable to check changes before then.
+
+You'll notice that the script detected many UAPI changes that are not
+backwards compatible. Knowing that kernel UAPIs are supposed to be stable
+forever, this is an alarming result. This brings us to the next section:
+caveats.
+
+Caveats
+=======
+
+The UAPI checker makes no assumptions about the author's intention, so some
+types of changes may be flagged even though they intentionally break UAPI.
+
+Removals For Refactoring or Deprecation
+---------------------------------------
+
+Sometimes drivers for very old hardware are removed, such as in this example::
+
+    % ./scripts/check-uapi.sh -b ba47652ba655
+    Installing user-facing UAPI headers from ba47652ba655... OK
+    Installing user-facing UAPI headers from ba47652ba655^1... OK
+    Checking changes to UAPI headers between ba47652ba655^1 and ba47652ba655...
+    ==== UAPI header include/linux/meye.h was removed between ba47652ba655^1 and ba47652ba655 ====
+
+    error - 1/910 UAPI headers compatible with x86 appear _not_ to be backwards compatible
+
+The script will always flag removals (even if they're intentional).
+
+Struct Expansions
+-----------------
+
+Depending on how a structure is handled in kernelspace, a change which
+expands a struct could be non-breaking.
+
+If a struct is used as the argument to an ioctl, then the kernel driver
+must be able to handle ioctl commands of any size. Beyond that, you need
+to be careful when copying data from the user. Say, for example, that
+``struct foo`` is changed like this::
+
+    struct foo {
+        __u64 a; /* added in version 1 */
+    +   __u32 b; /* added in version 2 */
+    +   __u32 c; /* added in version 2 */
+    }
+
+By default, the script will flag this kind of change for further review::
+
+    [C] 'struct foo' changed:
+      type size changed from 64 to 128 (in bits)
+      2 data member insertions:
+        '__u32 b', at offset 64 (in bits)
+        '__u32 c', at offset 96 (in bits)
+
+However, it is possible that this change was made safely.
+
+If a userspace program was built with version 1, it will think
+``sizeof(struct foo)`` is 8. That size will be encoded in the
+ioctl value that gets sent to the kernel. If the kernel is built
+with version 2, it will think the ``sizeof(struct foo)`` is 16.
+
+The kernel can use the ``_IOC_SIZE`` macro to get the size encoded
+in the ioctl code that the user passed in and then use
+``copy_struct_from_user()`` to safely copy the value::
+
+    int handle_ioctl(unsigned long cmd, unsigned long arg)
+    {
+        switch _IOC_NR(cmd) {
+        0x01: {
+            struct foo my_cmd;  /* size 16 in the kernel */
+
+            ret = copy_struct_from_user(&my_cmd, arg, sizeof(struct foo), _IOC_SIZE(cmd));
+            ...
+
+``copy_struct_from_user`` will zero the struct in the kernel and then copy
+only the bytes passed in from the user (leaving new members zeroized).
+If the user passed in a larger struct, the extra members are ignored.
+
+If you know this situation is accounted for in the kernel code, you can
+pass ``-i`` to the script, and struct expansions like this will be ignored.
+
+Flex Array Migration
+--------------------
+
+While the script handles expansion into an existing flex array, it does
+still flag initial migration to flex arrays from 1-element fake flex
+arrays. For example::
+
+    struct foo {
+          __u32 x;
+    -     __u32 flex[1]; /* fake flex */
+    +     __u32 flex[];  /* real flex */
+    };
+
+This change would be flagged by the script::
+
+    [C] 'struct foo' changed:
+      type size changed from 64 to 32 (in bits)
+      1 data member change:
+        type of '__u32 flex[1]' changed:
+          type name changed from '__u32[1]' to '__u32[]'
+          array type size changed from 32 to 'unknown'
+          array type subrange 1 changed length from 1 to 'unknown'
+
+At this time, there's no way to filter these types of changes, so be
+aware of this possible false positive.
+
+Summary
+-------
+
+While many types of false positives are filtered out by the script,
+it's possible there are some cases where the script flags a change
+which does not break UAPI. It's also possible a change which *does*
+break userspace would not be flagged by this script. While the script
+has been run on much of the kernel history, there could still be corner
+cases that are not accounted for.
+
+The intention is for this script to be used as a quick check for
+maintainers or automated tooling, not as the end-all authority on
+patch compatibility. It's best to remember: use your best judgment
+(and ideally a unit test in userspace) to make sure your UAPI changes
+are backwards-compatible!
