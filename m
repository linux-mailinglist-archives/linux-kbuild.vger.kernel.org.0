Hey Miguel,

Sorry for the late reply ;)

Absolutly, but with the many luitenants, many tree's, and not a single 
CI source, this would still be tricky in the end; but certainly possible.

And that's great of course, I was mearly speaking of the configuration 
of rustfmt. I think as a tool it's pretty great!

I think this is a pretty poor argument for following Rust's opinionated 
view of the world. E.g. it's generally bad to copy/paste code to begin 
with. How many 'bugs' that we know of are copy/paste bugs?

Secondly, and more importantly so; you argue 'who cares about people 
with disablements, atleast its equally hard to read everywhere' which is 
a very poor argument :p

Finally, it must of course be mentioned, that rust is really trying to 
do an XKCD here, https://xkcd.com/927/ though I'm sure we'll get it 
right this time around ;)

But you are not, only those that follow rust's biased view. Everybody 
else that has a different opinion (like die-hard C programmers) that 
care enough (I'm sure there's plenty) would setup their rustfmt config 
file to resemble their C code; and thus the entire premisis is broken. 
Though; yes, in a perfect world it could have worked like this, but xkcd 
again :)

This though is a fair argument I understand, it would be weird in having 
2 styles in user-space and kernel-space code; though I see this 
happening today as well; where developers follow kernel style for kernel 
code (obviously) but use their preferred 2 or 3 space style on their 
userland code. Trying to 'force' this, usually however never gets the 
intended result ...

Yeah, this is a common reasoning. People without disabilities often 
oversee cases to those with. E.g. Traffic lights being red and green is 
horrible for colorblind people; luckily enough we have 'order' to help 
distinguish there for example. While I'm not colorblind myself, I often 
have to remind UX designers, with their fancy LED based UI's, to think 
of others as well, which always strikes them as odd first, then of 
course they only start to realize this.

I'm with you that style is the least important for the functionality, no 
argument there. Long-term though; this will matter of course, to those 
like me, have hard times here.

The first exception to the rule starts here already :p
