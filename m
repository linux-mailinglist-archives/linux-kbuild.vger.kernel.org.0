Yes.

If you move the quoting to the variable reference,
it is acceptable because there is a good reason to do so.



UIMAGE_NAME ?=3D Linux-$(KERNELRELEASE)


            ...
             -n '$(UIMAGE_NAME)' -d $< $@


This is the correct change.

Right. Why don't you remove it, then?


For clarification, there is no concept of quoting in GNU Make.

The single quote character ' and the double quote character " are
just normal characters for Make.

GNU Make handles them just like alphabets and numbers.

GNU Make just replaces $(UIMAGE_NAME)
with 'Linux-$(KERNELRELEASE)' verbatim.


It is the _shell_ that understands the quoting.

Just in case here is the spec for
"2.2.2 Single-Quotes" vs "2.2.3 Double-Quotes"

https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html


Shell supports both single-quoting and double-quoting
for good reasons.

There is no good or bad because both of them are meaningful.

Please move the single quotes as I suggested above.

The reason is because UIMAGE_NAME can be passed-in
by a user and it can contain whitespaces.
