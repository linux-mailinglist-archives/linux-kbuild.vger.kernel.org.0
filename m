Because their hardware department has invented a whole new way of dealing
with a bunch of things at the hardware level (for some reason).

Also almost all laptop vendors have a whole bunch of laptop vendor
specific userspace API in the form of sysfs files exported by
drivers/platform/x86/laptop-vendor.c drivers. E.g. do:

ls /sys/bus/platform/devices/thinkpad_acpi/

An any IBM/Lenovo Thinkpad (and only on a Thinkpad) to see a bunch
of laptop vendor specific UAPI.

Since I've become the pdx86 subsys maintainer I've actually been
pushing back against adding more of this, instead trying to
either use existing UAPIs, or defining new common UAPIs which can
be shared between vendors.

So I agree very much with you that we need to be careful about
needlessly introducing new UAPI.

But there is a difference between being careful and just nacking
it because no new UAPI may be added at all (also see GKH's response).

The USB protocol just defines a transport layer, outside of the USB classes
there are plenty of proprietary protocols on top of that transport.

And this chardev just offers access to the Surface Serial Hub transport
protocol. And if you want something even closer the i2cdev module offers
raw I2C transfer access and I2C defines no protocol other then
how to read or write a number of bytes.

I do a lot of hw enablement work and being able to poke HID / USB / I2C
devices directly from userspace is very useful for this.

So this ^^^ still stands, I agree with you that adding new UAPI needs
to be considered carefully and when I get around to reviewing this
that is exactly what I will do.

Maximilian, can you perhaps explain a bit more of what you want / expect
to use the chardev for, and maybe provide pointers to the matching
userspace utilities (which I presume you have) ?

AFAIK the idea is to be able to combine multiple physical devices, e.g.
a PCI device + an ACPI enumerated platform device and then slice the
combination of those 2 up in new devices which may use parts of both
parent devices, quoting from:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/driver-core.git/tree/Documentation/driver-api/auxiliary_bus.rst?h=driver-core-next&id=7de3697e9cbd4bd3d62bafa249d57990e1b8f294

"multiple devices might implement a common intersection of functionality"

IOW this is for cases where the simpler bus + devices model does not
work well. AFAICT in this case the simpler bus + devices does work
well, so there is no need to use the auxiliary bus.

It is relevant, you cannot expect drivers which were written during
the last 6 months to use functionality which is not even in the
mainline kernel yet (yes it is in -next, but not in mainline).

Now if that new functionality where to provide major benefits to
the code making it much cleaner / better then yes asking to rewrite
it to use that new functionality would make sense.

I need to take a closer look at the code but ATM I'm not convinced
that rewriting it to use the new auxiliary bus stuff will make it
better at all, let alone enough to warrant the effort of the rewrite.

Hans


p.s.

For the record I do not own any Microsoft Surface devices myself, so
I have no interests here other then to make sure that the Linux
kernel is welcoming to new new contributors and does not needlessly
scare them away.
