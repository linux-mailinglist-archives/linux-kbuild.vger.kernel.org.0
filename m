Yes.
It is possible to implement it, but I do not see a point
to implement what we do not know how to use.

It makes the purpose of this work even more obscure.

For the purpose of avoiding duplication,
we can take the first DTB (or the smallest size)
when we encounter a duplicated compatible string.

That is one way, but I do not think such a configuration file
is maintainable.

Rob suggested overwriting the compatible string,
but I do not think we got consensus.

I think this is yet another way, but I am not sure
how to derive the extension compatible string.






Even if we decide to implement base/overlay split,
we may not need to add anything to Makefile.

We already have .*.cmd files, and we can know
if it is a combined DTB or not, by parsing the .*.cmd
from the python script.

It might be a bit messy, but it is what we do
in scripts/clang-tools/gen_compile_commands.py
