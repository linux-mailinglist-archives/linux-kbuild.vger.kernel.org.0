Thanks for working on describing the M.2 connectors properly in the
device tree!

I haven't had time to look into this in detail yet, but a quick look at
the dt-bindings and examples looks good to me! Thanks for keeping the
bindings as generic as possible.

I have a small nitpick for the specific example you have here: The
Lenovo ThinkPad T14s does not actually have a "M.2 Mechanical Key E
connector". If you look at a picture of the mainboard [1], the WLAN/BT
module is "soldered-down" (look on the right, on the right side next to
the large copper bracket). In the M.2 specification, "soldered-down"
modules do not have a "key", they have a specific pinout that is
followed (see section 5.4). The power sequencing etc and the set of pins
is quite similar/the same though.

My notes (from a few months ago) suggest the T14s probably uses a
non-standard M.2 Type 1620 LGA pinout. I don't remember the exact chain
of thought behind that, but you can find similarly looking modules with
this type, e.g. https://www.sparklan.com/product/wnsq-290be/. There is a
1620 *BGA* pinout in the M.2 specification, but a 1620 *LGA* pinout does
not exist there. Interestingly, in the block diagram of the module in
the link above this type is called *Q*M.2 1620 LGA 168 pin, as if this
is some Qualcomm-specific form factor.

A real mechanical key E connector can be found e.g. in the X1E CRD, X1E
Devkit, or I think some of the X1E-based HP laptops (would need to check
which one exactly).

I'm not sure if it's really appropriate modeling the "soldered-down"
variant as "Mechanical Key E connector" in the DT. We might need
a separate compatible for this. Do you have any thoughts about that?

Thanks,
Stephan
