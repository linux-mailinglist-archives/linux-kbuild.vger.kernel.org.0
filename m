I don't recall analyzing this spot in detail but looking at it now I don't see
anything wrong with it. While the check is likely superfluous, I'm not against
keeping it in place.

And even that one is waiting for the live patch module name appear under
/sys/kernel/livepatch/. This is IMHO acceptable level of paranoia.
