I believe this has already been extensively discussed. I want to focus
more on the part below in this response:

I tend to agree that this is a valid concern to bring up, and adding a
new bus is not something that should be done lightly.

Let's ignore that this has been merged into -next after I've submitted
this (and that I only recently became aware of this) for the time being.
If I would see a clear benefit, I would not hesitate to switch the
driver and subsystem over to this.

What does concern me most, is the device/driver matching by string.
Right now, this subsystem matches those via a device UID. This UID is
directly tied to the EC functionality provided by the device. A bit of
background to this:

Requests sent to the EC contain an address, so to say. This consists of

  - Target category (TC): Broad group of functionality, e.g. battery/AC,
    thermal, HID input, ..., i.e. a subsystem of sorts.

  - Target ID (TID): Some major device, e.g. the dual batteries on the
    Surface Book 3 are addressed by target ID 1 and 2, some functionality
    is only available at 2 and some only at 1. May be related to physical
    parts of/locations on the device.

  - Instance ID (IID): A device instance, e.g. for thermal sensors each
    sensor is at TC=0x03 (thermal) and has a different instance ID.

Those can be used to pretty much uniquely identify a sub-device on the
EC.

Note the "pretty much". To truly make them unique we can add a function
ID (FN). With that, we can for example match for TC=0x03, TID=*, IID=*,
FN=0x00 to load a driver against all thermal sensors. And this is
basically the device UID that the subsystem uses for matching (modulo
domain for virtual devices, i.e. device hubs). Sure, we can use some
string, but that then leads to having to come up with creative names
once we need some driver specific data, e.g. in the battery driver [1]:

     const struct auxiliary_device_id my_auxiliary_id_table[] = {
         { .name = "surface_aggregator_registry.battery", .driver_data = x },
         { .name = "surface_aggregator_registry.battery_sb3", .driver_data = y },
         { },
     }

Arguably, not _that_ big of a deal.

What worries me more is that this will block any path of auto-detecting
devices on a more general/global level. Right now, we hard-code devices
because we haven't found any way to detect them via some EC query yet
[2] (FYI the node groups contain all devices that will eventually be
added to the bus, which are already 11 devices on the Surface Book 3
without taking missing thermal sensors into account; also they are
spread across a bunch of subsystems, so not just platform). That's of
course not an ideal solution and one that I hope we can eventually fix.
If we can auto-detect devices, it's very likely that we know or can
easily get to the device UID. A meaningful string is somewhat more
difficult.

This registry, which is loaded against a platform device that, from what
we can tell differentiates the models for some driver bindings by
Windows (that's speculation), is also the reason why we don't register
client devices directly under the main module, so instead of a nice
"surface_aggregator.<devicename>", you'll get
"surface_aggregator_registry.<devicename>". And it may not end there.

Something that's currently not implemented is support for thermal
sensors on 7th generation devices. With thermal sensors, we can already
detect which sensors, i.e. which IIDs, are present. Naturally, that's
part of the EC-API for thermal devices (TC=0x03), so would warrant a
master driver that registers the individual sensor drivers (that's a
place where I'd argue that in a normal situation, the auxiliary bus
makes sense). So with the auxiliary bus we'd now end up with devices
with "surface_thermal.sensor" for the sensors as well as
"surface_aggregator_registry.<devicename>", both of type ssam_device
(which then would be a wrapper around auxiliary_device with UID stored
in that wrapper). Note that they need to be of type ssam_device (or
another wrapper around that) as they again need the reference to the
controller device, their UID for access, etc. With a proper bus, device,
and the UID for matching, we can just add the sensor devices to the bus
again, as they will have a meaningful and guaranteed unique UID.

 From some reports I've seen it looks like thermal sensors may also be
available separately on TID=0x01 as well as TID=0x02 on some devices,
at which point I believe you'd need to introduce some IDA for ID
allocation to not cause a clash with IDs. At least if you separate the
base drivers for each TC, which I guess should be preferred due to
code-reuse. Then again they might use different event registries so you
may end up needing "surface_thermal.sensor_tc1" and
"surface_thermal.sensor_tc2" as device names to differentiate those
for driver loading. Or store the registry in software node properties
when registering the device.

I'm repeating myself here, but to me it looks cleaner to have a single
bus type as opposed to spreading the same base auxiliary device type
over several namespaces.

Which then leads me to the question of how a function like
"is_ssam_device()", i.e. a function testing if the device is of a given
type, would be implemented without enforcing and testing against some
part of the device name. Something that, again, doesn't look clean to
me. Although the use of such a function could probably avoided, but that
then feels like working around the auxiliary bus.

Unfortunately, there are a couple more hypotheticals at play than I'd
like to have (making this not an easy decision), but it's a reverse
engineered driver so I guess that comes with the territory. All in all,
I believe it's possible to do this (i.e. use the auxiliary bus), but, to
me at least, the implementation using a discrete bus feels tidier and
more true to the hardware (or virtual hardware anyway) behind this. I'm
happy to hear any arguments against this though.

Max
