No.

The dpkg-deb on Ubuntu works multi-threaded by default.

Just try /usr/bin/dpkg-deb installed by APT, then
you will see more than 100% CPU resources used.


With proper library installed, "./configure" for dpkg
should show:

  checking for lzma_stream_encoder_mt in -llzma... yes


With HAVE_LZMA_MT_ENCODER defined, filter_xz_get_cputhreads()
returns the number of threads to use.
The default is the number of available CPU cores.

As above, dpkg-deb works in parallel.

It is still possible to force the single-threading by "export
DPKG_DEB_THREADS_MAX=3D1",
but many people already benefit from multi-threaded compression, which is t=
he
default behavior on recent distributions.
