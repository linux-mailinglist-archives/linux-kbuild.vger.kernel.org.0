It is the naming, we don't have char device for every "laptop" vendor.
Why is Microsoft different here?

USB devices implement standard protocol, this surface hub is nothing
even close to that.

I don't know how it goes in device/platform area, but in other large
subsystems, UAPI should be presented with working user-space part.

The idea behind auxiliary bus is to slice various functionalities into
different sub-drivers, see it as a way to create subsystem inside one
driver.

It is not relevant, the code is merged than it is ready.

The auxiliary bus is merged and part of linux-next.

I naked explicitly for two reasons: UAPI(chardev) and lack of rationale
for the custom bus, never said "bad code".
