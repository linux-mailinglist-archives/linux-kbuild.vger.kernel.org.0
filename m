I assumed it was something to do with one of the wrappers I'm using but
didn't get to the bottom of it because I'm using quite a few.

But I just checked now and it's just bear [1] that causes the issue.
Maybe it sets errno before forking and that persists in the child
processes? Not 100% sure how it works. I did debug scripts/kallsyms and
errno was already set on the first line of main(), so it's not some
other library call in kallsyms that is setting it but not being checked.

The minimal reproducer for me looks like this:

  bear -- make ARCH=arm64 LLVM=1 O=../build/
