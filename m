Ok. I retract my comment on v4 about removing the HOST prefix then.

I'm fine with HOSTPKG_CONFIG (what's in v4); follows the style of
HOSTCC and HOSTCXX.

If the folks sending this are working on CrOS, better find what's in
their build system. Chun-Tse?

(I feel like I'm behind the times again, like when `apt-get install`
became old news in favor of `apt install`...)

I'm not sure, but do we need to cross that bridge for this patch if
it's just adding support for the HOST? No cross pkg-config necessary,
yet. (Famous last words).
