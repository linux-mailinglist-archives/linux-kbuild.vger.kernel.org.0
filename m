Understood, then why attempt to use a union for this type of "abi safe
padding"?

That's the goal here, you want to create an abi that can change over
time without "breaking" the abi.  Usually this is just adding additional
padding in structures to have room for new additions.

Remember the "goal" here is to NOT have to modify the places in the
kernel that use the new field in the structure, but for that to "just
work".  Your change here wouldn't allow that as any use of the new "b"
field would have to be through something in "Struct2", not directly in
Struct1, right?

We can mess with the structure definitions but we should not have to
touch the places where the structure fields are used at all.  If that's
going to be a requirement (as it sounds like it would with the use of
unsafe in the union), then this is not going to be a solution at all.
