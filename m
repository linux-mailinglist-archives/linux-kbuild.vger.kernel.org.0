As far as I understood, the conclusion is

[1] There is nothing to fix on the Kbuild side.
     (So, this patch was rejected)


[2] If you want to use scan-build for kbuild,
        "scan-build --use-cc=3Dclang" should work properly.

   The "disable RETPOLINE' workaround is also unneeded.

  $ scan-build --use-cc=3Dclang make -j16 defconfig bindeb-pkg

   should be enough


[3]  If scan-build supports mixed-compilers, it is up to LLVM community.
      If they are happy, they will carry the pain of maintaining ignored fl=
ags.



The detection of retpoline flags is not working somehow.

$ /usr/share/clang/scan-build-13/bin/../libexec/ccc-analyzer
-mindirect-branch=3Dthunk-extern  -c -x c /dev/null -o /dev/null
could not find clang line
$ /usr/share/clang/scan-build-13/bin/../libexec/ccc-analyzer
-mretpoline-external-thunk  -c -x c /dev/null -o /dev/null
gcc: error: unrecognized command-line option =E2=80=98-mretpoline-external-=
thunk=E2=80=99

I think this should be fixed.
