Thanks. You are right.

Correct. They are different things.

Parsing the headers located in the same directory seems
to be a design.

I think the attached patch is correct.
I will pick it up later.



One question is, is this feature still used?

I assume the answer is yes because you noticed this bug.
(but you are the first/only person who noticed it
in the past 3 years)






Thanks.
