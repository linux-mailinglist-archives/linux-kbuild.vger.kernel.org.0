Yes. 'make clean' must keep all the build artifacts
needed for building external modules.

Symbols.list should be kept by the time mrproper is run.
So, please add it to MRROPER_FILES instead of CLEAN_FILES.

modules.livepatch is a temporary file, so you can add it to
CLEAN_FILES.

How is this feature supposed to work for external modules?

klp-convert receives:
"symbols from vmlinux" + "symbols from no-klp in-tree modules"
+ "symbols from no-klp external modules" ??



BTW, 'Symbols.list' sounds like a file to list out symbols
for generic purposes, but in fact, the
file format is very specific for the klp-convert tool.
Perhaps, is it better to rename it so it infers
this is for livepatching? What do you think?
