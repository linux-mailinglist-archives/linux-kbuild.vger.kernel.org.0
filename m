I'm not so certain why you are so focused on the names and UIDs.
The names are simply the aliases and needed to match between major
device driver that is responsible for the discovery and triggering
sub-driver with implementation.

Nothing prohibits from the logic: "if uid = 123; trigger "sensor""

Different devices and separation between them (*_registry module)
are expected to be in that main driver.

As an outcome of it, you will get: proper module autoload, device
discover and power management.
