There is no way to make the code universal in the time optimization here,
and various devices need to be customized, but we have some solutions to
achieve the maintenance and recovery of these devices,
especially the scanning and initialization of pci devices

Yes, sha256 is a better choice, but if there is no memory copy between
kexec load
and kexec -e, and this part of the memory is reserved. Don't think
this part of memory will be changed.
Especially in virtual machine scenarios

I initially implemented re-adding a parameter and region, but I
figured out later
that it doesn't really make sense and would waste extra memory.

Reuse the memory reserved by the crash kernel? Why does it increase
memory consumption?

Thanks for pointing that out.
but Even if the data is detected to have been changed, there is
currently no way to recover it.
I don't have a good understanding of this place yet. maybe for security rea=

Maybe parameters will be a better choice. What do you think ?

I don't think so. The kernel startup time of some lightweight virtual
machines maybe
100-200ms (start_kernel->init). But this kexec->start_kernel took more
than 500ms.
This is still valuable, and the overall code size is also very small.
