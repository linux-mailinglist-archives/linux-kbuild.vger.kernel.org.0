Basically the same thing.  Doesn't seem worthwhile to me to have both.
When reading the code, it's not at all obvious why you would define a
new name for PCI_ID_F_VFIO_DRIVER_OVERRIDE.

I missed your point.  Isn't the above basically the 09/12 patch [1] we're
talking about?

Yes, I see the code structure is slightly different, but the question
we're talking about here is the name of the "flags" field and the enum
or #define for the VFIO bit.

> I prefer the "flags" naming since its more generic and easy to extend.

We don't need to worry about "flags" being generic or extensible until
we need to extend it.  It's easy to fiddle with it at that point.

> can we continue with the above suggestion for V2 ?

I don't see what really changed with the above suggestion.

The point I'm trying to make is that using PCI_ID_F_VFIO_DRIVER_OVERRIDE 
in pci_match_device() suggests that the code there has some connection
or dependency on VFIO, but it does not.
