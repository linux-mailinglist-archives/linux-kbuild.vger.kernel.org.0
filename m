Hello Kris,

Thank you for your contribution and for having your thought shared with me.

Allow me to begin this conversation by explaining what came to mind when
I decided to propose a patch that creates aliases.

The objective was to address a specific problem I was facing while
minimizing any potential impact on other aspects.
My initial consideration was the existence of numerous tools, both in the
kernel and in userspace, that rely on the current kallsyms implementation.
Both Nick and I shared the concern that making changes to elements upon
which these tools depend on could have significant consequences.

To the best of my knowledge, Nick's strategy has been to duplicate kallsyms
with something new - a new, improved kallsyms file.

However, even if Nick's patch were to be accepted, it wouldn't fully meet
my personal requirements.
This is because my goal was to utilize kprobe on a symbol that shares its
name with others. Nick's work wouldn't allow me to do this, and that's why,
I proposed an alternative.

As a result, my strategy was more modest and focused solely on creating
aliases for duplicate symbols.
By adding these aliases, existing tools would remain unaffected, and the
current system state and ecosystem would be preserved.
For instance, mechanisms like live patching could continue to use the
symbol hit count.

On the flip side, introducing these new symbols would enable tracers to
directly employ the new names without any modifications, and humans could
easily identify the symbol they are dealing with just by examining the
name.
These are the fundamental principles behind my patch - introducing aliases.

In the current implementation, my work is capable of "addressing" the issue
only for duplicate symbols within the core kernel image.
This is a fact.
Currently, modules are not within the scope of my work.

Originally, my intention was to deal with duplicates in modules as the
subsequent objective.

I agree with you that addressing duplicate symbols in modules is something
that needs to be resolved, but from my perspective, it appeared to be of
lesser importance.
This is because, when trace tools are used manually, there is already an
indication of the modules where the name originates.

In this context, I would welcome the opportunity to explore additional use
cases.
By doing so, I can better align any future proposals with these real-world
scenarios and requirements I'm not considering in this moment.

In my initial intention, I had hoped to extend the use of aliases to modules
as well.
However, I encountered some challenges that need to be addressed first.
If I were to continue with this strategy, it would necessitate an impact on
the current build flow, which is something that should be discussed before
taking any concrete steps.

To identify which symbols are duplicated, including those contained in
modules, it requires exploring all the objects. If I were to propose a
complementary tool to kas_alias that operates on modules, it would need to
run on all objects to ascertain the state of the names.
Only after this assessment could it produce its output.
This would entail postponing the second kallsyms pass until after all
modules have been processed.
Additionally, modules would need to be processed twice: once to assess the
names and a second time to generate aliases for duplicated symbols.
I am uncertain if the community would be willing to accept such a delay in
the build process to introduce this feature.

Another point worth noting is the importance of exporting this duplicate
name report in public headers to ensure consistency for oot modules.

These are my thoughts on the potential extension of my work to encompass
symbol duplicates in loadable modules. I'm genuinely interested in hearing
your perspective and ideas. If you're planning to explore a completely
different approach or believe that the alias strategy may not be the most
effective way forward, I would be happy to collaborate and combine our
efforts to propose a patch that comprehensively addresses the issue of
symbol duplicates in all its facets. Sharing our expertise and working
together could lead to a more robust and inclusive solution for the Linux
kernel community.

Personally, I don't perceive any specific benefit in including the module name
as part of the decoration. Please don't get me wrong; I do recognize that it
enhances clarity in Nick's work.
In that context, a human can easily discern that a duplicated name originates
from a module, aiding in understanding which symbol they require as it is
already for duplicates coming from modules.

However, when it comes to my current implementation, I don't see a compelling
reason to include module name into the decoration I append to names aliases.
Please accept my apologies if I may not be taking into account any obvious use
cases, but as it stands, I don't find a strong rationale for incorporating
module names into the symbol decoration.

In any case, as you've pointed out, duplicates can arise from names in code
that is not intended to be a module.
Therefore, relying solely on the module name would not fully address the
problem you initially aimed to solve.
