Thanks for the clarifications.  Please note that shipping .o_shipped
files with upstream Linux will not happen out of obvious reasons, and I
am not willing to invest time into supporting any closed-source
approach.

You might want to try to add the missing rules to your local modules'
Kbuild file, e.g. something like

$(obj)/%.o: $(obj)/%.o.cmd

$(obj)/%: $(src)/%_shipped | $(obj)/%.o.cmd
	$(call cmd,copy)

(not tested, no support).

Good luck and kind regards,
Nicolas
