From what I can see in this series, the bindings required adding
a number of generic functions to the Rust support code and also most
discussion revolved around that. I'm worried this might be the case also
for foreseeable future updates, until more building blocks are in place.
It then makes me think most changes to this code will need to go through
the Rust tree for now.

On the other hand, if the changes are reasonably limited to mostly
rust/kernel/module_param.rs and rust/macros/module.rs, then yes, I'd say
it should be ok to take the patches through the modules tree.

@Luis, Sami, Daniel, please shout if you see any problem with this.
