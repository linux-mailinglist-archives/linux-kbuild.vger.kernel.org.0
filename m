Trying to take a closer look this time...

I foresee merge conflicts, but so it goes.  Trying to split this apart
would not make a lot of sense.

Please use normal tables rather than list-table; this kind of thing is
really unreadable in the source form.

I foresee disagreements over coding style conventions in the

I will ask whether we want this, though.  Why would anybody want to
mass-reformat the entire body of kernel code?  This seems like something
that would generate an endless stream of "helpful" patches and a lot of
churn.
