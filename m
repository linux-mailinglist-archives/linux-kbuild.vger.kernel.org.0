Usually, the ambiguous symbols are used as internal functions and
are easily changed by kernel update. Thus it is only used for debugging.
On the other hand, exposed symbols are considered as more stable (It's
not really that stable.) so users tend to use that.

BTW, note that `perf probe` and kprobe-events already supported that by
'_text+OFFSET' style to point those functions (`perf probe` convert the
given 'function@file-path' place to '_text+OFFSET' using DWARF and ELF).
BPF doesn't because it only supports "function name". (I'm not sure how
Dtrace support it)

If we really consider to improve BPF trace to trace such internal functions,
I think you should consider to reuse perf-probe's code to find actual
address and convert it to '_text+OFFSET' style to specify the probe point.

I think this still useful if user can identify the traced symbol from the
source code line, easily without DWARF analysis. And BPF also need to
support "SYMBOL+OFFSET" style probe points.

As I said, these internal symbol tracing is usually only for debugging
the kernel. So I think this is not so problematic.
