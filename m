There is already a prototype of such a driver. It can be found at https://g=
ithub.com/Rust-GCC/cargo-gccrs. Unlike what the name suggests it is not car=
go specific. It consists of two binaries. The first calls cargo, but tells =
it to use the second binary instead of a real rustc. This second part then =
translates all arguments to what gccrs expects. It is possible to directly =
invoke this second binary. For now it probably won't work for rust-for-linu=
x though as it doesn't have all arguments that are used by rust-for-linux i=
mplemented.

As alternative to GCC Rust there is also github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen=
_gcc/ which uses libgccjit as backend for the official rust compiler rather=
 than writing a full Rust frontend for GCC from scratch. With a bit of patc=
hing to force it to be used, I was able to compile all Rust samples with GC=
C using rustc_codegen_gcc. However it gives warnings of the following kind:

    ld.lld: warning: rust/built-in.a(core.o):(.data.rel.local) is being pla=
ced in '.data.rel.local'

And hangs very early in the boot process. If I enable early logging, it pri=
nts up to "Booting the kernel." and then does nothing. This is probably bec=
ause support for setting a different relocation model is not yet implemente=
d. I opened https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc/issues/205 for t=
his.

There may be other issues, but rustc_codegen_gcc is probably going to be th=
e easiest route towards a LLVM free rust-for-linux build. By the way note t=
hat rust-bindgen which we use for generating rust bindings from C headers d=
epends on LLVM. See https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen/issues/1949.

Cheers,
Bjorn
