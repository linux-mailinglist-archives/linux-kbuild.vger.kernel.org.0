It should, as long as people are at least upgrading LTS releases
continuously. In theory, there could be people who upgrade with a
configuration that has CONFIG_CFI_CLANG=y to a release after the rename
to CONFIG_CFI happens but at that point, I would expect them to need to
diff their configuration to make sure other items did not go missing or
change since they are going across many months/releases when upgrading.
I think doing it this way is a healthy balance of not breaking the
people who upgrade their kernels yearly (via LTS) or every stable
release while allowing the code as a whole to become more generic in the
meantime.

Folks who have CONFIG_CFI_CLANG=y in defconfigs like Android should
notice it disappearing and be able to figure out that it got renamed and
adjust, since they already have to do that for other symbols.

Cheers,
Nathan
