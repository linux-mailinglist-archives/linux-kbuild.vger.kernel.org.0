It isn't an ABI, but we really do try to avoid breaking if we can and
I rember Linus shouting at people if they did that for common options.

However lately for example the completely silly s/THUNDERBOLT/USB4/

through external nvme drive :(

Why do we need to have VFIO_PCI_CORE as a user visible option?
I'd just select it.
