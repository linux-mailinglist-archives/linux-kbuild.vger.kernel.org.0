I am afraid that there can be more symbols with the same name in a
single source file. For example, static variables defined inside
functions:

$> cat >test-duplicate-symbols.c <<EOT
#include <stdio.h>

void a(void)
{
	static int duplicate_var = 100;

	printf("%s: %d\n", __func__, duplicate_var);
}

void b(void)
{
	static int duplicate_var = 200;

	printf("%s: %d\n", __func__, duplicate_var);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv)
{
	a();
	b();
}
EOT

$> gcc -o test-duplicate-symbols test-duplicate-symbols.c

$> ./test-duplicate-symbols 
a: 100
b: 200

$> objdump -t test-duplicate-symbols | grep duplicate
test-duplicate-symbols:     file format elf64-x86-64
0000000000000000 l    df *ABS*  0000000000000000              test-duplicate-symbols.c
0000000000402018 l     O .data  0000000000000004              duplicate_var.2190
000000000040201c l     O .data  0000000000000004              duplicate_var.2195

Yeah, livepatching needs to be able to find any symbol which might
need to be accessed from the livepatch.

The line number is perfectly fine for livepatching because there
is 1:1:1 relationship between the kernel sources, binary, and
livepatch.

And it might be even useful for the tracing. It helps to find
and investigate the traced code easily.

Hmm, I understand that it complicates the live for the trace
tooling. I wonder if we could allow searching the symbols
with a pattern, e.g. the bash style
"duplicated_symbol_name-source_file_c*"

Please, do not make the format configurable. I think that it will
cause more harm than good. It would make the life more complicated
for developing tracing tools.

The tools would need to support all the formats as well. Or they
would support only some and will not be able to trace kernels
with the others. Both is bad.

Anyway, thanks a lot for working on this.
